In ENG 201, you'll do qualitative research on contemporary scholarly conversations taking place in your academic (your major) or professional (your intended career) fields; you'll identify a specific discourse concerning a recent/ongoing problem or tension that scholars in/of your field are trying to figure out &mdash; that repeatedly surfaces in those conversations. This qualitative semester-long research study is meant to position you as researchers engaging in contemporary, ongoing conversations in your fields.

You'll be assigned both high-stakes and low-stakes writing, where low-stakes or informal writing assignments are designed to give you time and space to work through a text or complex idea, and high-stakes writing consists of larger assignments and evolves through peer collaboration, analytical writing, and revision. In doing so, you'll come to better understand the communicative expectations associated with your field.
