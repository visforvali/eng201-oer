This course website for the asynchronous Fall 2025 section of ENG 201: Writing in the Disciplines at Pace University, taught by Dr. Vyshali Manivannan, uses the [Jekyll Gitbook](https://sighingnow.github.io/jekyll-gitbook/){:target="_blank"} theme by Tao He © 2019. The theme is open sourced under the Apache License, Version 2.0, using the same license as the original GitBook repository.

This website was developed in response to having generative AI forced into my course LMS, where it fabricates lies, steals student writing (and increasing false positives in plagiarism detection), and manipulates students and faculty into believing they can outsource any part of their thought process without suffering proportional cognitive atrophy. It also streamlines our technological platforms to Discord (for class discussion and low-stakes writing); and this site for course content (with essay drafts to be posted to Classes).

This site contains:

- Class announcements
- ENG 201 syllabus
- ENG 201 calendar (the home page)
- Alt-grading system
- Weekly modules, including PDFs of or links to assigned readings
- Discord tutorial
- Instant full-text search and page indexing
- Collapsible sidebar navigation menu
- and class playlists!
