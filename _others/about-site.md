This course website for ENG 201: Writing in the Disciplines at Pace University, taught by Dr. Vyshali Manivannan, uses the [Jekyll Gitbook](https://sighingnow.github.io/jekyll-gitbook/){:target="_blank"} theme by Tao He. Jekyll Gitbook is open source under the Apache License Version 2.0, the same license as the original GitBook repository.

- a collapsible sidebar navigation menu, and
- back-to-top and next/previous page functions at the bottom of each page.

## ENG 201 Course Website
{:.no_toc}

This course website was developed in response to having generative AI forced into course learning management systems, where it fabricates lies, steals student writing (and increases false positives in plagiarism detection), and manipulates students and faculty into believing they can outsource _any_ part of their thought process without proportionally atrophying their brains.

This website was also designed to streamline our technological platforms to Discord (for class discussion and low-stakes writing); and this site for course content (with essay drafts to be posted to Classes).

This site contains:

- a [course syllabus](../syllabus){:target="_blank"},
- a [course calendar](../calendar){:target="_blank"},
- [announcements][announcements](/eng201-oer/jekyll/2025-07-31-w0.html){:target="_blank"},
- a description of our [alt-grading system](../alt-grading){:target="_blank"},
- course [assignments](../assignments){:target="_blank"} and [general feedback](../feedback){:target="_blank"},
- course materials, including weekly modules &mdash; starting with [Module 0](/eng201-oer/jekyll/2025-08-01-w1.html){:target="_blank"} &mdash; and linked PDFs of readings and other resources, and
- a [Discord Tutorial](../discord){:target="_blank"}
