This page will contain frequently asked questions as they're asked and answered in class, text channels, coffee chats, and elsewhere. I'll note updates to the FAQs periodically on Discord, but keep checking back, too!

# How do I schedule a coffee chat with you?

You can reserve an appointment with me on Zcal, by visiting my scheduling link directly or clicking the "Book a Coffee Chat!" button on the home page. Follow the directions on Zcal to schedule your appointment. First, select the time interval you want (🕛10, 🕐15, or 🕑20 min) at the bottom left, then choose a date/time that works for you.

**If you're in an async section, please be aware that I can't require sync one-on-one meetings and therefore have limited availability outside of these hours.** You must contact me **at least 1 week in advance** to schedule a chat outside of my standard coffee chat times. I’m almost never able to accommodate last-minute requests.

If there are no available timeslots on a given day, it means I'm fully booked and you'll have to reserve another date/time. I tend to be fully booked around the middle and end of the semester, so make sure to book early and often!
