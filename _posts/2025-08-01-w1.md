Choose an online name for yourself &mdash; this should be a pseudonym that has nothing to do with your IRL identity, the kind of handle you might choose for a social media account, for maximum anonymity (please keep it PG). Without mentioning your IRL name (or other identifying details), draft a short, casual introduction that answers the following: What's your alias? Why did you choose it? And what's one fact or quote that lives rent-free in your brain? You'll share this introduction on Discord later in this module, after you've joined our server and customized your profile. 


## Introducing the Course

Welcome to ENG 201: Writing in the Disciplines, offered by the Dept. of English, Writing, and Cultural Studies at Pace University – Pleasantville (PLV). Our composition class is unique in that it aims to simultaneously teach you how to:

1. Conduct qualitative research, and
2. Enter the distinct discourse community of your discipline. 

> ##### If You'll Be Writing a Thesis
> ENG 201 will teach you to emulate the disciplinary conventions of your field in preparation for future scholarly and professional texts you'll write, using qualitative research as the vehicle for your learning. If you can apply discipline-specific moves across genres of writing, you can easily employ them in the writing tasks of your field.

ENG 201 centers research and method to support students in exploring contemporary field-related concepts through research and writing that synthesizes primary and secondary sources. Our low- and high-stakes writing work is designed so you can engage with your field, understand how information is presented, what is valued, and how it is developed and determined, and practice writing for those communicative expectations. 

In PLV's core writing program, all sections of a given core writing course use the same framework, with similar objectives, themes, organization, assignments, and grading policies. This section of ENG 201 is designed for the PLV core writing program and has similar requirements regarding participation, drafting and revision, and collaborative work. It presumes prior content knowledge and writing skill &mdash; in a basic sense at least, no content mastery required &mdash; from ENG 120, including the ability to: recognize and define discourse communities; do discourse analysis; understand the rhetorical situation; close-read popular, literary, and scholarly articles; use library databases; and document your sources. 

If you're unfamiliar with the format and expectations of PLV core writing courses, or if you've gotten rusty since you took ENG 120, you may initially feel lost. And that's okay! No one masters anything in a single semester, anyway. Whether you didn’t take a PLV section of ENG 110 or 120, or did but only vaguely remember what you learned, you can succeed in this course! Just be aware of our actual course expectations, and don't base your understanding of core writing courses or writing in the disciplines on anecdotal information about what this course has been like for others.

## Learning Objectives:

In the first week of this course, you'll learn:

- How this course will be organized and what will be expected from you in each class and each week
- What "writing in the disciplines" means
- 

GitBook is an amazing frontend style to present and organize contents (such as book chapters
and blogs) on Web. The typical to deploy GitBook at [Github Pages][1]
is building HTML files locally and then push to Github repository, usually to the `gh-pages`
branch. However, it's quite annoying to repeat such workload and make it hard for people do
version control via git for when there are generated HTML files to be staged in and out.

This theme takes style definition out of generated GitBook site and provided the template
for Jekyll to rendering markdown documents to HTML, thus the whole site can be deployed
to [Github Pages][1] without generating and uploading HTML bundle every time when there are
changes to the original repository.
