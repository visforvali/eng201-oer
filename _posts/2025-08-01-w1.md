# Learning Objectives:

In the first week of this course, you'll learn:

- How this course will be organized and what will be expected from you in each class and each week
- How to use our primary tech platforms (Discord, this website)

# Welcome to ENG 201!

Welcome to ENG 201: Writing in the Disciplines, offered by the Dept. of English, Writing, and Cultural Studies at Pace University – Pleasantville (PLV). Our composition class is unique in that it aims to simultaneously teach you how to:

1. Conduct qualitative research, and
2. Enter the distinct discourse community of your discipline. 

ENG 201 is designed to build on previously learned writing skills, using qualitative research to help you develop argumentation, analytical skills, advanced research skills using primary and secondary sources, and to help you develop the patient, curious, dogged mentality needed for many kinds of writing. 

> ##### If You'll Be Writing a Thesis
> This course will teach you to emulate the disciplinary conventions of your field in preparation for future scholarly and professional texts you'll write, using qualitative research as the vehicle for your learning. If you can apply discipline-specific moves across genres of writing, you can easily employ them in the writing tasks of your field.
{: .block-tip }

ENG 201 centers research and method to support students in exploring contemporary field-related concepts through research and writing that synthesizes primary and secondary sources. Our low- and high-stakes writing work is designed so you can engage with your field, understand how information is presented, what is valued, and how it is developed and determined, and practice writing for those communicative expectations. And because writing is a social activity, you'll also work closely in small groups (to be assigned by Week 3) in asynchronous discussions and peer workshops. 

In PLV's core writing program, all sections of a given core writing course use the same framework, with similar objectives, themes, organization, assignments, and grading policies. This section of ENG 201 is designed for the PLV core writing program and has similar requirements regarding participation, drafting and revision, and collaborative work. It presumes prior content knowledge and writing skill &mdash; in a basic sense at least, no content mastery required &mdash; from ENG 120, including the ability to: recognize and define discourse communities; do discourse analysis; understand the rhetorical situation; close-read popular, literary, and scholarly articles; use library databases; and document your sources. 

If you're unfamiliar with the format and expectations of PLV core writing courses, or if you've gotten rusty since you took ENG 120, you may initially feel lost. And that's okay! No one masters anything in a single semester, anyway. Whether you didn't take a PLV section of ENG 110 or 120, or did but only vaguely remember what you learned, you can succeed in this course! Just be aware of our actual course expectations, and don't base your understanding of core writing courses or writing in the disciplines on anecdotal information about what this course has been like for others.

# Getting to Know Our Tech Environments

This first week is dedicated to settling into the course: joining our Discord server, becoming fluent in its operation, and familiarizing yourself with Classes and this course website. 

# Reading This Website

In addition to hosting our course documents, i.e. syllabus etc., this website contains material I composed for this class as well as links to open-access or freely available articles and resources relevant to writing in the disciplines (WID) and qualitative research composed by other individuals and departments. It's an un-textbook, a handbook, a how-to manual, a cookbook, a guide &mdash; a collection of readings, instructions, models, and practice exercises that can be read/used linearly or in any order, depending on your learning needs (though if possible I recommend you stick closely to the workflow suggested in the course calendar). 

> ##### Note
> Out of respect for your selection of an asynchronous modality, and to reduce everyone’s screen fatigue, audiovisual content is intentionally kept to a minimum.
{: .block-tip }

The weekly modules included here bring together text-based lessons, audiovisual content, writing exercises, and model student papers from students at Pace and elsewhere. Each module identifies important general and discipline-specific methods for doing research and research writing and explains how you can practice them in your ENG 201 qualitative research project. As their titles indicate, these modules will guide you through different aspects of the research process &mdash; such as developing research questions; doing secondary and primary research; organizing, synthesizing, and presenting data; and the discipline-specific nature of communication expectations.

Each module is designed to stand alone and with other course materials. There are also appendices with content aimed at particular academic specializations. You'll be directed to these appendices throughout the semester, but I encourage you to reference the appendices relevant to your discipline whenever you need to.

# So: You've Chosen an Async Course

Asynchronous classes are fully remote and self-paced, meaning you aren't required to synchronously interact with your instructor or classmates at a set meeting time. If you're taking this async section to be able to maximize work and credit hours, be advised: While async courses permit greater flexibility in terms of arranging your schedule, they are usually more time- and labor-intensive. You'll need to spend more time on trying to understand course material on your own if the instructor isn't immediately available, and you'll also need to stay motivated and on track even when life, work, and other classes get in the way. Not having set meeting times and real-time oversight from professors can make it easy to lose focus or fall behind, especially if you have a busy schedule already.

## Classes 

Classes is unconducive to real learning since it encourages a grades-oriented mindset of "let me get my work done and GTFO with minimal interaction," and now it's also full of surveillance over your attendance and GenAI training on your work and feeding it to plagiarism checkers. To avoid that circus, I've created an external course website for us &mdash; this website!

I'll primarily use Classes to collect your high-stakes writing assignments in dropboxes in Classes\Assignments and to share your scores in Classes\Gradebook. For privacy and security reasons, the invitation link to our Discord server is posted under Content\Syllabus. 

## Course Website 

Here's a brief overview of what you can find on this website.

- **Home**: Has the course calendar, along with details like meeting time, modality, and how to schedule with me. The Calendar states the weekly "theme" and contains links to the weekly modules and any writing due that week. The readings are listed at the top of each week. Aim to read as much of them as possible before class on Tuesday, which is when any weekly responses are due.
- Many of these readings are short, so we can spend a lot of time focusing on how they're put together in addition to their content. And they're eclectic &mdash; I reached for things I thought you might not have encountered before.
- **Announcements**: Any announcement I make on Discord will also be cross-posted here. You can find them on Discord by ctrl-F "Announcements" or check this page.
- **Syllabus**: Course description, course-specific policies, and Pace policies.
- **Alt-Grading**: If you're actively engaged in working through everything we do, I want to make sure that random circumstance doesn't interfere with your grades. Participation emphasizes asking questions rather than answering them.

# Discord

The Discord Tutorial (linked at the bottom of the sidebar menu) has a breakdown of Discord's basic functions. If you've never used Discord, don't be intimidated! Discord's controls are a lot like text messaging or social media. You can get by with these 3 main functions: 

- Click #text channels on the left to enter them, type in the message box, and hit enter to send; 
- Click 🧵 and 📌 at the top of #text channels for a directory of threads (click a thread name to join and send messages in the panel that appears) and pinned posts; and 
- Click 🔊Voice channels on the left 1x to join voice-only and 2x to join voice-and-video.

In text channels, the chat bar is located in the main view, at the bottom-center of the screen. The message box is where you type your messages (which are visible to all members of the channel). In voice channels, the main view displays the users in the voice channel and the controls.

**FAQs**: Frequently asked questions will be posted here, as they’re asked and answered!
**Playlist**: And on the fun side of things, there’s a playlist page curated by me and former students if music helps stir the words in you.
Navigation:	
You can navigate to these pages using the links on the side. Each page also has internal links and a table of contents for accessibility purposes. The links at the top will take you to: my Zcal scheduling page [click], where you can see my available times during my Coffee Chat hours. 

Take a moment to setup Discord if you haven’t already. First, customize your profile. Upload a profile picture, and enter your display name &mdash; an alias, like mine, so that relative anonymity can help ease barriers to participating in writing &mdash; and your pronouns. If you don't choose a pseudonym by the end of the week, I'll choose one for you and will change your profile accordingly. You can paste/fill out one of the placeholders in the About Me section in the Discord tutorial too, if you like.

Once you've done that, click on the #get-roles channel and select the ones that describe you. Your selections will automatically be added to your profile.

Check the Discord tutorial for instructions on how to adjust your user preferences, like color themes, font size and spacing, etc. It also has a "What's Where" section is a directory of channels and what we'll use them for.

> ##### 🛑 Stop! Write! Submit!
After you've joined our server and customized your profile, choose an online name for yourself &mdash; this should be a pseudonym that has nothing to do with your IRL identity, the kind of handle you might choose for a social media account, for maximum anonymity (please keep it PG). Without mentioning your IRL name (or other identifying details), draft a short, casual introduction that answers the following: What's your alias? Why did you choose it? And what's one fact or quote that lives rent-free in your brain? Share this introduction in #classroom on Discord.

# It's Okay Not to Know!

ENG 201 courses are made up of students and instructors who come from very different disciplinary backgrounds. Each person in the classroom has a different level of familiarity and comfort with different disciplinary conventions: for instance, a business major will know something about writing business reports, but may know less about writing an anthropology paper or engineering report. Similarly, I possess expertise in writing, medicine, communication and media studies, and the fine arts, and I'm familiar with legal writing and science writing, but I may not be expert in the writing conventions of your discipline.

This course isn't meant to "test" your knowledge of research or discipline-specific writing. You're not supposed to know everything about writing in your discipline right now, and that's OK! 

ENG 201 as a class best approached as a community of learners. I'll guide you through the process of writing a qualitative research paper and will help you read to identify disciplinary conventions and practice those conventions in your papers. And as we work together this semester, I hope you can accept that real, productive learning begins with discomfort: that means accepting that you don't already know everything; being responsible for asking questions in our classroom text chat; having to reveal the gaps in your knowledge and mistakes you make in order to learn; staying calm in the face of discomfort (avoid "I'm going to fail" panic or fury); and finding time as your schedule permits to have sync coffee chats with me if you're confused.

I believe in critical, accessible, social justice pedagogies. What this means for you is: a flexible, responsive course architecture, lessons, and professor-student communication; equitable classrooms, assignments, and grading schema; and an expectation that you'll be actively involved in reviewing the course, creating community, and learning. You can always reach out to me with a concern by @ing me on Discord, DMing me directly, or sending me an email (my contact info is in the Course Book).
