Annotated Bib

To help you with the Lit Review, you‚Äôll write an Annotated Bibliography that organizes your secondary research, which you've been doing through Google Scholar and Pace library databases. 

Your sources must be peer-reviewed scholarship. Check out this Pace LibGuide for info on what a peer-reviewed article  and this NC State interactive guide on the parts of a scholarly article. To make sure you can use a source, evaluate it using the tests here. 

The Annotated Bibliography includes 6 secondary sources. You should close-read and summarize each article in 1 paragraph, using the course materials to guide you. Take notes on major themes connecting the articles, so you can group them according to thematic connection. 

Your Annotated Bibliography should include:

Two sections, with 3 article summaries in each section (no repeat uses)
Each summary should describe the article‚Äôs particular thesis and findings
Subheading titles for each section, named for the 2 major themes connecting the 3 articles in that section
Correctly formatted citations using MLA or APA

Your Annotated Bibliography entries should look like:

Category Title

CITATION (formatted in MLA or APA)
Article summary (1 paragraph)
What do the specific arguments and conclusions in this article tell you about your research question?

CITATION.
etc.

You‚Äôll also include an ‚ÄúUnbibliography‚Äù with your Annotated Bibliography: A list (doesn‚Äôt need to be formatted) of 3-5 sources you considered using but ultimately rejected, with a brief (250-500 word) reflection on why you considered them and why you decided against them.

Try to complete all the entries but if you can only do 3 Annotated Bibliography entries (2 in 1 section, 1 in the other) and 2 Unbibliography entries, that's OK, but I'll have less to comment on.

Please post your prewriting activity as 1-2 replies or an attached file to this topic!

e.g.,

```markdown
The well known Pythagorean theorem $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ was
proved to be invalid for other exponents[^1].
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:

$$ x^n + y^n = z^n $$
