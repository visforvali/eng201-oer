# Mythbusters: The Academic Edition

<img src="https://visforvali.github.io/eng201-oer/assets/gitbook/images/ch_jargon.gif" alt="Calvin and Hobbes comic strip describing academic writing as impenetrable jargon" width="30%">

*Image: Calvin & Hobbes comic strip making fun of academic writing as impenetrable and obscure.*

This comic illustrates the stereotype of academic writing: that if it *doesn't* "inflate weak ideas, obscure poor reasoning, and inhibit clarity," it's not good writing. 

Since you're about to start drafting the first part of your qualitative research project, it's a good time to debunk some of these stereotypes and figure out ways to sustain yourself through a long-term writing project.

**Myth**: Writing in the disciplines is something that only happens in core writing courses.

**Reality**: You're not just in college to earn degrees, just like you're not just in classes to learn about subject matter &mdash; you're always also learning about an academic discipline and acquiring disciplinary knowledge. An academic discipline is a field of knowledge in systems of knowledge production with distinct problems, assumptions, methodologies, and communicative expectations. (For instance, scientists, historians, and performing artists are all trained to perceive and explain phenomena very differently!)

**Myth**: Good writers know exactly what they want to say before they start writing.

**Reality**: Good writers learn by writing &mdash; which is how we think and process our thoughts! &mdash; and remain adaptable and open to having their minds changed. 

**Myth**: Readers, especially academic audiences, are seeking black and white explanations.

**Reality**: All readers want to read work that unpacks the complexity of an issue &mdash; and they trust writers who aren't afraid of trying to explain and account for all the complexities of an issue!

**Myth**: Your research hypothesis should be one-sentence long.

**Reality**: Your research hypothesis should require ~5 sentences minimum, since research hypotheses consist of several steps or concepts that take multiple sentences to explain. 

**Myth**: I can do most of this work the night before the deadline.

**Reality**: In *Write No Matter What*, Joli Jensen recommends "frequent, low-stress contact with a project that interests me, in a supportive environment" to sustain academic writing. The best approach is to work on something for your qualitative research project a little every day. The scaffolded, often collaborative nature of the work we do in this class means that you'll probably struggle if you delay working on assignments until close to the deadline. 

# Developing Research Questions

Qualitative research questions can be posed without citing existing literature, but they always grow out of existing literature.

Research questions (RQs) do one or more of the following: 

- **Contextual RQs**: Identify and describe a phenomenon
- **Descriptive RQs**: Describe a phenomenon
- **Explanatory RQs**: Examine a phenomenon or analyze the reasons or relationships between phenomena
- **Exploratory RQs**: Consider unknown dimensions of a phenomenon
- **Ethnographic RQs**: Build on existing literature
- **Case Study RQs**: Describe and explore a particular case study

Drafts often begin with research questions, but once you've read enough to tentatively answer them, you'll replace the RQs with research hypotheses. *problem statements*, or the hypothesis you've arrived at by trying to answer that question, signaling to the reader that the paper will explain how you arrived at that hypothesis.

Here are some examples that demonstrate different kinds of research questions. Try to identify each kind of RQ below, then check yourself by clicking the spoiler text to reveal the answer.

- What are the experiences of nurses working night shifts in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic?

>! Spoiler text
> Explanatory, both examining a phenomenon and analyzing the relationships between two phenomena (night shift nursing, COVID-19)

- How have contemporary public perceptions of genetic engineering impacted scientific funding for genetic research?

>! Spoiler text
> Descriptive, describing a phenomenon; and ethnographic, likely to build on research into public perceptions of genetic engineering 

- What are the forms of disrespect and abuse experienced by women criminal justice attorneys, and how does this impact substance abuse in the profession?

>! Spoiler text
> Contextual, identifying and describing a phenomenon; and exploratory, considering unknown dimensions (misogyny) of a known problem (substance abuse)

- How have changes in research protocols around human subjects improved (or not) human subject research in anthropological research?

>! Spoiler text
> Exploratory, considering unknown dimensions of a problem (changes in research protocols); case study, likely to examine 1-2 case studies; ethnographic, likely to build on existing case studies to examine their research protocols

Qualitative research questions are frequently revisited, reviewed, and revised. The tentative answers you pose to your research questions, i.e. your research hypotheses, are always preceded by a statement describing a phenomenon, after which they broadly explore a complex set of factors surrounding that phenomenon.

# Practicing Disciplinary Thinking

Membership in a disciplinary community requires learning to "talk the talk" &mdash; becoming literate in the discipline's ways of thinking and writing, language, genres, and practices, knowing what to say to people inside a disciplinary community and those outside of it. 

> ###### Disciplinary Scholarship = by Disciplinary Members 
> It's fine if you find yourself reading scholarly articles for your preliminary research that aren't produced in your disciplinary community; just remember that the disciplinary conventions you should pay attention to must come from scholarship produced by members of your field. 
{:.block-warning}

Professions emerge from disciplines taught in college, and disciplines are informed by professions and their evolution outside of college. Developing your research questions and writing a discipline narrative are opportunities to continue reflecting on what you consider your discipline, how it connects to the work you're doing in your major, and where and how you're being trained in disciplinary thinking. It can help you think about crafting a research paper to ask yourself: What models have you been given so far? What phrases, terms, abbreviations, etc. do you encounter in your major courses? (For instance, an education major might ask themselves: "What am I learning about being a teacher? About thinking like a teacher? About the language of teaching and education?")

Extrapolating research questions from preliminary research can also help you figure out where to look specifically to develop these disciplinary literacies, by exposing you to the kinds of writing done in your field and the language that gets deployed in the discourses surrounding a specific problem, tension, challenge, or issue faced by your discipline.

The texts produced by members of your discipline is where you can see disciplinary literacies *and the thought processes behind them* in action. Remember, writing *is* thinking, so how disciplinary writing is disciplinary thinking! For example (if you need a reminder), the hard sciences' reliance on third-person perspective and passive voice conveys a sense of clinical distance and objectivity that is a crucial part of scientific work and identity. Social science research, especially ethnographies, are much more likely to use first-person and subjective, vivid description, illustrating their need to contrast the researcher's perspective with the group or phenomenon being observed.

# What Is a Discipline Narrative?

The discipline narrative is one such place to practice disciplinary thinking and writing in your qualitative research project. Your discipline narrative is a more elaborate summary of the phenomenon (plus surrounding factors) 

described in your research questions, 

This description of the phenomenon and its surrounding factors will be folded into your discipline narrative, which for the purpose of this assignment constitutes the 2 paragraphs that precede the 1 paragraph of research hypotheses in your Research Introduction.

# Writing Tip!

When it comes to writing, nothing is static. What once worked for your writing process once may not work in the future. Your changing circumstances may change how you write. When that happens, clinging to what worked before will just hold you back. (For instance, hyperfocus might work for a while, then give way to scheduled ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù free-writes, where you write to see where your thinking takes you; or no outlining might yield to index cards and research.)


Here are some resources to help demystify the process of reading scholarly articles, evaluating sources for incorporation in ENG 201 papers, and practicing disciplinary writing techniques. Additionally, academic readers have to specialize in reading research sources through discipline-specific lenses, so they can more easily assign more importance to certain ideas. 

In order to write in the disciplines, you have to prioritize reading in the disciplines as well.
