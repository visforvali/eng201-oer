# Mythbusters: The Academic Edition

<img src="https://visforvali.github.io/eng201-oer/assets/gitbook/images/ch_jargon.gif" alt="Calvin and Hobbes comic strip describing academic writing as impenetrable jargon" width="30%">

*Image: Calvin & Hobbes comic strip making fun of academic writing as impenetrable and obscure.*

This comic illustrates the stereotype of academic writing: that if it *doesn't* "inflate weak ideas, obscure poor reasoning, and inhibit clarity," it's not good writing. 

Since you're about to start drafting the first part of your qualitative research project, it's a good time to debunk some of these stereotypes and figure out ways to sustain yourself through a long-term writing project.

**Myth**: Writing in the disciplines is something that only happens in core writing courses.

**Reality**: You're not just in college to earn degrees, just like you're not just in classes to learn about subject matter &mdash; you're always also learning about an academic discipline and acquiring disciplinary knowledge. An academic discipline is a field of knowledge in systems of knowledge production with distinct problems, assumptions, methodologies, and communicative expectations. (For instance, scientists, historians, and performing artists are all trained to perceive and explain phenomena very differently!)

**Myth**: Good writers know exactly what they want to say before they start writing.

**Reality**: Good writers learn by writing &mdash; which is how we think and process our thoughts! &mdash; and remain adaptable and open to having their minds changed. 

**Myth**: Readers, especially academic audiences, are seeking black and white explanations.

**Reality**: All readers want to read work that unpacks the complexity of an issue &mdash; and they trust writers who aren't afraid of trying to explain and account for all the complexities of an issue!

**Myth**: Your research hypothesis should be one-sentence long.

**Reality**: Your research hypothesis should require ~5 sentences minimum, since research hypotheses consist of several steps or concepts that take multiple sentences to explain. 

**Myth**: I can do most of this work the night before the deadline.

**Reality**: In *Write No Matter What*, Joli Jensen recommends "frequent, low-stress contact with a project that interests me, in a supportive environment" to sustain academic writing. The best approach is to work on something for your qualitative research project a little every day. The scaffolded, often collaborative nature of the work we do in this class means that you'll probably struggle if you delay working on assignments until close to the deadline. 








# Developing Research Questions

Qualitative research questions can be posed without citing existing literature, but they always grow out of existing literature.

Research questions (RQs) do one or more of the following: 

- **Contextual RQs**: Identify and describe a phenomenon
- **Descriptive RQs**: Describe a phenomenon
- **Explanatory RQs**: Examine a phenomenon or analyze the reasons or relationships between phenomena
- **Exploratory RQs**: Consider unknown dimensions of a phenomenon
- **Ethnographic RQs**: Build on existing literature
- **Case Study RQs**: Describe and explore a particular case study

Drafts often begin with research questions, but once you've read enough to tentatively answer them, you'll replace the RQs with research hypotheses. *problem statements*, or the hypothesis you've arrived at by trying to answer that question, signaling to the reader that the paper will explain how you arrived at that hypothesis.

Here are some examples that demonstrate different kinds of research questions. Try to identify each kind of RQ below, then check yourself by clicking the spoiler text to reveal the answer.

- What are the experiences of nurses working night shifts in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic?

>! Spoiler text
> Explanatory, both examining a phenomenon and analyzing the relationships between two phenomena (night shift nursing, COVID-19)

- How have contemporary public perceptions of genetic engineering impacted scientific funding for genetic research?

>! Spoiler text
> Descriptive, describing a phenomenon; and ethnographic, likely to build on research into public perceptions of genetic engineering 

- What are the forms of disrespect and abuse experienced by women criminal justice attorneys, and how does this impact substance abuse in the profession?

>! Spoiler text
> Contextual, identifying and describing a phenomenon; and exploratory, considering unknown dimensions (misogyny) of a known problem (substance abuse)

- How have changes in research protocols around human subjects improved (or not) human subject research in anthropological research?

>! Spoiler text
> Exploratory, considering unknown dimensions of a problem (changes in research protocols); case study, likely to examine 1-2 case studies; ethnographic, likely to build on existing case studies to examine their research protocols

Qualitative research questions are frequently revisited, reviewed, and revised. The tentative answers you pose to your research questions, i.e. your research hypotheses, are always preceded by a statement describing a phenomenon, after which they broadly explore a complex set of factors surrounding that phenomenon.

# What Is a Discipline Narrative?

This description of the phenomenon and its surrounding factors will be folded into your discipline narrative, which for the purpose of this assignment constitutes the 2 paragraphs that precede the 1 paragraph of research hypotheses in your Research Introduction.

The discipline narrative 



https://oer.pressbooks.pub/opentrailstechnicalwriting/chapter/understanding-disciplinary-expectations-for-writing/

Entering into a discipline requires us to become literate in the discipline’s language and practice. If membership in a disciplinary community is what we’re after, we must learn to both “talk the talk” and “walk the walk.” At its foundation, disciplinarity is developed and supported through language—through what we say to those within a disciplinary community and to those outside of the community. Students begin to develop as members of a disciplinary community when they learn to communicate with the discipline’s common symbols and genres, when they learn to “talk the talk.” In addition, students must also learn the common practices and ways of thinking of the disciplinary community in order to “walk the walk.”

The great part of being a student is that you have an opportunity to learn about many disciplinary communities, languages, and practices, and savvy students can leverage the knowledge and relationships they develop in school into professional contexts. When we leave our degree programs, we hope to go on the job with a disciplined mind—a disposition toward the world and our work that is informed by the knowledge, language, and practices of a discipline.

Do you ever wonder why nearly every job calls for people who are critical thinkers and have good written communication skills? Underlying this call is an interest in disciplined ways of thinking and communicating. Therefore, using schooling to acquire the knowledge and language of a discipline will afford an individual with ways of thinking, reading, writing, and speaking that will be useful in the professional world.2 The professions extend from disciplines and in turn, disciplines become informed by the professionals working out in the world. In nursing, for example, academic instructors of nursing teach nursing students the knowledge, language, and practices of nursing. Trained nurses then go out to work in the world with their disciplined minds to guide them. At the same time, nurses working out in the world will meet new challenges that they must work through, which will eventually circle back to inform the discipline of nursing and what academic instructors of nursing teach in their classrooms.

It is important to realize that not all college professors and courses will “frame” teaching and learning in terms of disciplinarity or professionalism, even though it informs almost everything that happens in any classroom. As a result, it may be difficult to see the forest for the trees. Courses can become nothing more than a series of lectures, quizzes, assignments, activities, readings, and homework, and there may be few identifiable connections among these things. Therefore, students who are using school to mindfully transform into professionals will build into their academic lives periodic reflections in which they consider their disciplines and the ways they’re being trained in disciplinary thinking. They might stop to ask themselves: What have I just learned about being a nurse? About thinking like a nurse? About the language of nursing? This reflection may happen at various times throughout individual courses, after you complete a course, or at the end of completing a series of courses in a particular discipline. And don’t ever underestimate the value of forming relationships with your professors. They’re insiders in the discipline and profession and can provide great mentorship.

Okay, okay. Be more mindful of your education so that you acquire disciplinary and professional literacies. You get it. But what can you do—where can you look specifically—to start developing these literacies? There are many possible responses, but as writing teachers we will say this: Follow your discipline’s and profession’s texts. In these texts—and around them—is where literacy happens. It’s where you’re expected to demonstrate you can read and write (and think and act) like a professional.

Here are some resources to help demystify the process of reading scholarly articles, evaluating sources for incorporation in ENG 201 papers, and practicing disciplinary writing techniques. Additionally, academic readers have to specialize in reading research sources through discipline-specific lenses, so they can more easily assign more importance to certain ideas. 

In order to write in the disciplines, you have to prioritize reading in the disciplines as well.
