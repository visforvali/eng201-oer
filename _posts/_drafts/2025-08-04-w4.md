In *Write No Matter What*, Joli Jensen recommends "frequent, low-stress contact with a project that interests me, in a supportive environment" to sustain academic writing.

When you come to college, you are not just coming to a place that grants degrees. When you go to class, you‚Äôre not only learning skills and subject matter; you are also learning about an academic discipline and acquiring disciplinary knowledge. In fact, you‚Äôre entering into a network of disciplines (e.g., engineering, English, and computer science), and in this network, knowledge is produced that filters into the world, and in particular, into professional industries. An academic discipline is defined as a field of knowledge within the university system with distinct problems and assumptions, methodologies, and ways of communicating information.1 (Think, for instance, about how scientists view the world and conduct their studies of things in the world in ways different than historians do.)

Entering into a discipline requires us to become literate in the discipline‚Äôs language and practice. If membership in a disciplinary community is what we‚Äôre after, we must learn to both ‚Äútalk the talk‚Äù and ‚Äúwalk the walk.‚Äù At its foundation, disciplinarity is developed and supported through language‚Äîthrough what we say to those within a disciplinary community and to those outside of the community. Students begin to develop as members of a disciplinary community when they learn to communicate with the discipline‚Äôs common symbols and genres, when they learn to ‚Äútalk the talk.‚Äù In addition, students must also learn the common practices and ways of thinking of the disciplinary community in order to ‚Äúwalk the walk.‚Äù

The great part of being a student is that you have an opportunity to learn about many disciplinary communities, languages, and practices, and savvy students can leverage the knowledge and relationships they develop in school into professional contexts. When we leave our degree programs, we hope to go on the job with a disciplined mind‚Äîa disposition toward the world and our work that is informed by the knowledge, language, and practices of a discipline.

Do you ever wonder why nearly every job calls for people who are critical thinkers and have good written communication skills? Underlying this call is an interest in disciplined ways of thinking and communicating. Therefore, using schooling to acquire the knowledge and language of a discipline will afford an individual with ways of thinking, reading, writing, and speaking that will be useful in the professional world.2 The professions extend from disciplines and in turn, disciplines become informed by the professionals working out in the world. In nursing, for example, academic instructors of nursing teach nursing students the knowledge, language, and practices of nursing. Trained nurses then go out to work in the world with their disciplined minds to guide them. At the same time, nurses working out in the world will meet new challenges that they must work through, which will eventually circle back to inform the discipline of nursing and what academic instructors of nursing teach in their classrooms.

It is important to realize that not all college professors and courses will ‚Äúframe‚Äù teaching and learning in terms of disciplinarity or professionalism, even though it informs almost everything that happens in any classroom. As a result, it may be difficult to see the forest for the trees. Courses can become nothing more than a series of lectures, quizzes, assignments, activities, readings, and homework, and there may be few identifiable connections among these things. Therefore, students who are using school to mindfully transform into professionals will build into their academic lives periodic reflections in which they consider their disciplines and the ways they‚Äôre being trained in disciplinary thinking. They might stop to ask themselves: What have I just learned about being a nurse? About thinking like a nurse? About the language of nursing? This reflection may happen at various times throughout individual courses, after you complete a course, or at the end of completing a series of courses in a particular discipline. And don‚Äôt ever underestimate the value of forming relationships with your professors. They‚Äôre insiders in the discipline and profession and can provide great mentorship.

Okay, okay. Be more mindful of your education so that you acquire disciplinary and professional literacies. You get it. But what can you do‚Äîwhere can you look specifically‚Äîto start developing these literacies? There are many possible responses, but as writing teachers we will say this: Follow your discipline‚Äôs and profession‚Äôs texts. In these texts‚Äîand around them‚Äîis where literacy happens. It‚Äôs where you‚Äôre expected to demonstrate you can read and write (and think and act) like a professional.

In the video below, Jessica Kiebler from Pace University Library explains the ENG 201 Discipline Narrative:

Here are some resources to help demystify the process of reading scholarly articles, evaluating sources for incorporation in ENG 201 papers, and practicing disciplinary writing techniques. Additionally, academic readers have to specialize in reading research sources through discipline-specific lenses, so they can more easily assign more importance to certain ideas. 

In order to write in the disciplines, you have to prioritize reading in the disciplines as well.
