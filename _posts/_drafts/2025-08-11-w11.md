# Goals and Checklist

- Practice reading feedback rhetorically

You are not responsible for reading any papers posted to Slack #workshop after Wednesday. If you post your draft late, you are still responsible for reviewing the other essays by Friday. You will submit your Phase 1 Draft 2 to the dropbox on Classes by 5pm on Friday. The peer review forms ‚Äî one for each of your peers ‚Äî are due by 5pm on Friday as well just to give you extra time in case you need it, but you should complete them as early as you are able.




You‚Äôll conduct interviews for the primary research component of the Qualitative Research Paper. Here are some things to consider with regards to qualitative interviewing.
An effective interview starts with a few (maybe 5-8) open-ended clear and unbiased questions that allow respondents to explore your topic in depth. Asking ‚Äúhow‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy‚Äù questions almost always allow for this kind of exploration. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù questions are trickier, but if they invite answers that are longer than one word or phrase, they can work well, too. Cluster questions around similar topics so your participants‚Äô responses more easily flow from one to the next. A semi-structured interview approach might be preferred, where you have a few structured (scripted) questions and looser topics that permit follow-up or clarification questions after a respondent answers.

Check out this pair of interviews: a Demo qualitative interview with mistakes and Demonstration Qualitative Interview - how it should be done, both done by Joanna Chrzanowska with I-TECH.


STOP
For information on writing, asking, and recording interview questions, check out Harvard‚Äôs [Strategies for Qualitative Interviews](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/files/sociology/files/interview_strategies.pdf). For examples, check out these sample student coded interview transcripts.


Stop! Write:
Once you have interviewed your participants and transcribed your interviews, begin coding them. You can code words, phrases, and a full sentence but avoid coding an entire paragraph or response with the same code. Aim to have most of the text coded‚Äîi.e., few words should be unmarked by the end of your coding cycle. Try the following to get started:
What words keep reappearing across the interview answers from all the participants? (Use color coding or the comment function to mark them.) Use them to name some codes!
What is the significance of these codes and how frequently they appear?
What themes keep reappearing across the interview answers from all the participants? How might you briefly describe them? (Use color coding or the comment function to mark them.) Use them to name some codes!
What is the significance of these codes and how frequently they appear?
