To help with various access needs, including task identification and separation and advance notice, I'll include an abbreviated list of tasks at the top of each weekly module. You can check these items off, but your input won't be saved after you close this window. **You remain responsible for checking the Calendar and ensuring that you're completing everything in a timely fashion.**

â€¢	OER: 4. How to Write Methodology & A6. Practicing with Student Work


A wide tables needs to be wrapped into a `div` with class `table-wrapper`
to make sure it displayed as expected on mobile devices. For example,

```markdown
<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

|title1|title2|title3|title4|title5|title6|title7|title8|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|

</div>
```

Will be rendered as

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

|title1|title2|title3|title4|title5|title6|title7|title8|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|

</div>
