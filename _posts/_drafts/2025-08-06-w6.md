Read Richard Straub | "Responding &mdash; Really Responding &mdash; to Other Students‚Äô Writing"


You are not responsible for reading any papers posted to Slack #workshop after Wednesday. If you post your draft late, you are still responsible for reviewing the other essays by Friday. You will submit your Phase 1 Draft 2 to the dropbox on Classes by 5pm on Friday. The peer review forms ‚Äî one for each of your peers ‚Äî are due by 5pm on Friday as well just to give you extra time in case you need it, but you should complete them as early as you are able.



This week is a good time to ask specific questions in #homework-help about writing a research introduction, since you‚Äôre fine-tuning phase 1 of drafting. You should come to class with specific questions about the assignment, as your questions may apply to everyone.

I‚Äôve assigned you into teams, so in your team channel on Discord, you‚Äôll conduct an asynchronous peer review. You may choose to do this entirely in your team channel or synchronously in the Study Room voice channel or on a separate call.
You‚Äôll read Straub‚Äôs ‚ÄúResponding ‚Äî Really Responding ‚Äî to Other Students‚Äô Writing‚Äù and will work on peer review with your workshops on Slack. By Sunday, I‚Äôll have randomly assigned you into workshop groups by inviting you to a specific workshop channel on Slack. Accept the invitation and coordinate with your peers in that channel regarding sharing and reading each other‚Äôs work.
I expect you to post your preliminary drafts ‚Äî NOT the ones you submit to me ‚Äî on Slack in your #workshop channel by 10:00am at the latest on Wednesday. You will spend class time reading and reviewing each other‚Äôs essays, in the manner that Straub describes. For each student paper you read, you will complete one of the Phase 1 Draft 1 Peer Review Forms posted under on D2L Classes under Week 3. All of your peers‚Äô papers must be read and peer review forms completed by 5:00pm on Friday at the latest, but it‚Äôs recommended you complete them earlier than that. You don‚Äôt have to post them; as soon as you hit submit on the Google Form, I‚Äôll automatically get a copy.
In addition to Straub‚Äôs suggestions, here are some structured instructions for conducting peer review.
Instructions for Peer Review
Staub‚Äôs essay describes an engaged form of peer review that asks you to read like a reader, not an editor or professor. Consider working in a Google Doc for ease of commenting through marginalia and end notes, and for seeing how other peers in your group respond to the same piece.
Make time in Week 3 for drafting and for peer review, which will include reading, commenting, and collaboratively completing a Phase 1 Draft 1 Peer Review Worksheet.
Out of respect for your team members, please post your drafts by Wednesday so everyone has time to read and review before the end of the week.
Here are the general instructions.
1.	Post a link or file of your essay to your Discord #team channel. If you post a Google Doc make sure you‚Äôve enabled sharing permissions; there‚Äôs a Google Docs onboarding doc in welcome and rules if you need it. Don‚Äôt talk about your essays! First, read without commenting.
2.	Read and make marginalia using the Comments feature. Underline/highlight what you think the claim is, make notes about what you think the writer‚Äôs aims are, etc.
3.	Under Worksheets and Handouts on Classes, click the folder that belongs to your Team. Complete the ‚ÄúP1 Draft 1‚Äù worksheet posted in that folder. There is one Google Doc in which all of you will type your comments, using the format indicated in the instructions in that sheet. (For: Writer‚Äôs name, From: From From)
4.	Your team members and me will have access to that Doc.
5.	After receiving feedback, read what your teammates wrote, and discuss any questions you have together as a group. You may want to ask questions about what their comments mean, how they suggest enacting those comments, collaboratively write your way towards enacting those comments, and so on.
6.	After you all finish the worksheet, write a brief reflective note (~500 words) at the end of your draft, like a short letter to me, summarizing the feedback you were given by your peers, identifying what you prioritized for revision and why, explaining which assignment parameters you think you met and which you think you need to keep striving towards. You may also reflect on the reasoning behind the decisions you made in revising your draft for submission to me: any regrets or difficulties you dealt with, your attitude towards the assignment and feedback, any burdens of college or life that crept into your work, and so on. Include this letter at the end of your draft ‚Äî in other words, you‚Äôll submit it as one file on Classes by the deadline.
Missing peer review counts as missed work, and impacts your final course grade, so make sure to complete peer review by the deadline. You will not be penalized if you don‚Äôt read drafts posted too late. I‚Äôll pay attention to when y‚Äôall post your drafts and will make note of those who actively participate in peer review and those who don‚Äôt.
If you have questions or want to meet with me, I‚Äôm available for coffee chats and DMs.
Happy writing and reviewing and I look forward to reading your drafts!
