Qualitative research collects data through first-hand observation, such as interviews. For this class, students will conduct “structured interviews,” where they will ask all participants the same set of predetermined questions. Qualitative research is valuable because it allows the researcher to explore social interactions, provides an in-depth understanding of how people interact and create meaning, and clarifies “why” and “how” these experiences take shape.  

Develop five interview questions related to the selected research topic;
Organize questions in a logical sequence.



By now you should have conducted at least one of your interviews. If the interview is synchronous and oral, you must record it and transcribe it (create a word-for-word transcript).

When you finish conducting and transcribing your interviews, you'll organize this textual data using qualitative coding. Qualitative coding is a fancy name for pattern recognition. Copy all of the transcripts you have so far into one file and label each one with the interviewee’s name, the date of the interview, the platform (F2F, video conferencing technology, email), and length (time). 

Read them and note the patterns occurring across all three. Write down these patterns, naming them as specifically as possible -- these are your first cycle codes! First cycle codes are the big categories that will include more specific second cycle codes. 

Reference Saldana's piece on coding especially for the following! 

List your first cycle codes at the top of the document & keep them in mind as you go line by line and identify second cycle codes. Try to assign 1-2 second cycle codes to each response, giving them names that connect to your first cycle codes.

Create a color scheme for your second cycle  codes and color-code each line to connect lines to a specific second cycle theme theme. (You may use the comments function instead of color coding if that's easier.) 

Your coded transcripts might look like:

[First Cycle Code 1] Educational Classroom Issues

[List of Second Cycle Codes]

Green = Teaching from a lesson plan
Yellow = Managing behavior

[First Cycle Code 2] Emotional Labor and Mental Health

[List of Second Cycle Codes]
Red = Frustration with administration
Purple = Anxiety about workload
Blue = Supporting students through trauma
Etc.

INTERVIEW 1
Name: [Dialogue. Dialogue dialogue.]
Name: [Dialogue]
Etc.

Try to code every line -- they may be similarly or differently themed -- and post your prewriting as a reply to this thread!

Interviews or Blog/Vlog Analysis 

While students draft their literature reviews, they will conduct primary research in the form of interviews or blog/vlog analysis. Students will apply the questions crafted in Unit 1 in the form of three interviews or three blog/vlog entries. For the latter, students will review three selected blogs/vlogs and answer their interview questions from the material found in the post.  
Requirements:
Determine three possible interview participants;
Conduct and record three interviews (approximately 15 minutes each);
Transcribe interviews. 

Coding Transcribed Interviews and Blog/Vlog Analysis

After conducting and transcribing the interviews, students will code the content. Information is coded for the following reasons:
Codes in qualitative research are as important as numbers in a quantitative study;
Coding the qualitative data makes the messy scripts quantifiable and provides structure;
Your codes give you credibility as a writer with your audience;
Proper coding allows you to say with confidence that your findings truly represent the data you reviewed.

Coding is not looking over your interviews or media content once. The process is far more complex and requires several “passes” or steps taken to develop categories or themes;
Pass 1: In this step, you will review each interview line-by-line. While doing so, you will write summary statements in the margin of your paper--what you are noticing as you are reading, ideas and statements that directly relate to your research question. For example, you may notice a feeling of anger in the text (not from you). You should make a note of this. To do so, highlight the passage in your Word doc and select “comment.” Next, write in your thoughts. 
Pass 2: Once you are done with the first pass, you will now want to consider how your codes (for example anger) work together. This is known as developing categories or themes. 
At this stage, you should consider the connection between your codes. For example, codes such as anger, joy, frustration, etc. can be categorized as “emotion.” In your Word doc, assign each code a specific color and highlight all passages accordingly. Again, emotion could be highlighted red for example. 

Develop three categories or themes from your conducted interviews. 


# Exit Writing

🥳 Congratulations on getting through this chapter! Don't forget to check the [Calendar](https://visforvali.github.io/eng201-oer/){:target="_blank"} for the week's assignments, including your Tue question and Fri answer posts as well as any other assigned writing. Make sure to look ahead to future weeks as well to get a sense of when low- and high-stakes writing for Unit 1 is due.

# Reference List for This Week's Resources






> ###### Important!
> After scores are posted, review the [General Feedback](https://visforvali.github.io/eng201-oer/pages/feedback/){:target="_blank"} page  
{:.block-danger}

> ###### "Cr" = "Credit" = Imperfect and in Need of Revision
> If you received a "Cr" that means you need to revise! If you received an "Nc," make sure to review all feedback/responses I've given you (and your peers) since Unit 1 began and reread the Unit 1 assignment guidelines *before* reaching out to me. My first question to you, no matter what, will always be to ask you to explain to me why you think you received the score you did, to assess your engagement with and understanding of the course content so far and figure out how best to help you with future assignments.
{: .block-warning }

Given my alt-grading system, I am slow to respond to panicked communications about a single score that suggests you aren't familiar with how grading is handled in this class. Please check the alt-grading system before contacting me with any questions about your score (and avoid asking "Why did I get this score?" Instead, if you'd like to discuss a given score, tell me why you think you got it, and what you think needs to be done differently moving forward to improve your score on future drafts).

Keep in mind that a single score on a single draft doesn't mean much right now, as this course is holistically graded and what's improved in future drafts could render a single grade obsolete. If you're really drifting away from the assignment, an "Nc" score now should signal to you to go over the guidelines and all the comments I've given everyone to date in #classroom Q&A chats (which I track and expect you to implement in future work). Regardless of score, everyone will be doing serious revision, and that's to be expected at this point.

# Redefining Revision

You've probably been taught that revision means changing words, fixing punctuation, and making other grammatical and mechanical edits, but this is just one of three tiers:

- **Global revision**: Ideas (like your research hypotheses), your approach, selected sources, organization, audience(s) being addressed
- **Local revision**: Sentence fluency, sentence pacing, word choice
- **Proofreading**: Grammar, mechanics, formatting

> ###### Important!
> Your higher-order concerns (HOCs), i.e. top-level concerns, are global revision issues. Local revision and proofreading are lower-order concerns (LOCs), i.e. the very last thing you'll do this semester.
{:.block-danger}

Remember, if your research hypotheses, sources, approach, or structure need revision, then grammar and mechanics don't matter &mdash; you're just going to end up rewriting that sentence anyway.

It's also important to remember that the spirit of inquiry is the heart of the academic enterprise. Abrams (2022) reminds us that "revision isn't just about polishing &mdash; it's about seeing your piece from a new angle, with 'fresh eyes.'" It's easy to get so close to a draft we've recently written that we lose sight of how to improve it. It might even feel like we've done everything there is to do for the draft. We have to learn to see our own work from a different perspective to improve it. 

# Workshop Instructions

> ###### 🛑 Stop: Read!
> To prepare for this week's workshop, as well as revising on your own, read Richard Straub's ["Responding &mdash; Really Responding &mdash; to Other Students' Writing"](/eng201-oer/assets/pdfs/straub_responding_to_student_writing.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
{: .block-tip }

Staub's essay describes an engaged form of peer review that asks you to read like a reader, not an editor or professor. With Straub's advice in mind, answer the following questions in #team so you and your peers can come to a shared understanding of what a good workshop should be:

- Have you ever done a peer workshop before? What worked? What didn't?
- What do you hate about group assignments like workshops? How might you all avoid or minimize these issues?
- What opportunities do group assignments offer that working independently doesn't?
- What are you excited to get out of this workshop>
- In addition to the criteria in the feedback survey you'll be using to guide you, and *excluding any comments on grammar, mechanics, and formatting*, what specific requests do you have for your peer workshop group members?
- What is "good" feedback?

Accepting that you're student writers who are learning together (not experts authoritatively passing judgment on WID and qualitative research), good feedback is:

- Actionable and specific (Spelled out in a way that the writer can actually carry out in a timely fashion)
- Non-prescriptive (Offers suggestions, not demands)
- Generous (Doesn't assume the writer intended to make mistakes, whether it's misreading assignment directions, not staying grounded in research, etc.) while kindly telling the writer what they needed to do differently

Finally, this flowchart from Abrams' chapter will help you figure out what the culture and principles of your workshop group will be:

<img src="https://visforvali.github.io/eng201-oer/assets/abrams_workshop1.jpg" alt="Flowchart detailing steps for conducting workshop">

> ###### Don't Worry If Your Peers Are Late!
> You aren't responsible for reading any papers that weren't posted to #team by Sunday, but if you post your draft late, you're still responsible for reviewing the other essays by Friday. **Missing peer review *does* count as missed work**, and impacts your final course grade, so make sure to complete peer review by the deadline. I note when students post drafts and who actively participates in peer review and who doesn't. 
{: .block-warning }

This week, you'll asynchronously workshop each other's drafts in your #team channel. In addition to Straub's suggestions, here are some structured instructions for conducting peer review. 

# Process Reflection

When you post your draft to #team, you'll post a brief process reflection (~200-300 words) along with it. In this reflection post, you'll explain your process of working on this draft by answering some or all of the following:

- What were your thought processes in developing your ideas and doing your research?
- What do you wish you'd had more time to work on?
- What do you want to do between this draft and the next, regarding both what you want to do personally and what the assignment guidelines ask you to do?

> ###### Be Honest!
> Don't just tell me what you think I want to hear! Your task isn't to try to please me or impress me, but to help me help you refine your process of writing this project as well as refine your intentions for yourself as a developing writer. The more honest you are in your process reflections, the easier your revision decisions will get over time!
{: .block-warning }

You can identify the assignment parameters you think you met and why, referencing the modules and instructions as evidence, and which you think you need to keep striving towards. If you want to, you can also note any regrets or difficulties you faced, any burdens or college or life that crept into your work, your attitude towards the assignment, and so on.

# Workshop Instructions

Your workshop will be guided by the Feedback Survey below, which is a set of questions you should answer for each of your teammates' papers. 

Here are the general instructions:

1. Out of respect for your team members, please post your drafts (plus process reflection) to your #team channel by Tuesday so your peers have time to read and review before the end of the week. (If you post a Google Doc link make sure you've enabled sharing permissions.)

2. Using the questions and Abrams' flowchart pictured earlier in this module, chat briefly about how you approach workshops, what good feedback is, and what the culture and workflow of your workshop session is going to be.

3. Don't talk about your essays! First, read without commenting. You can read and make marginalia, underline/highlight what you think the claim is, make notes about what you think the writer’s aims are, etc.

4. Answer all the questions in the **Feedback Survey** below for each of your teammates' drafts, and post your answers as a reply to your teammate in your #team channel. **This process must be complete by Fri 11:59PM**.

5. After receiving feedback, read what your teammates wrote, and discuss any questions you have together as a group. You may want to ask questions about what their comments mean, how they suggest enacting those comments, collaboratively write your way towards enacting those comments, and so on.

# Feedback Survey: Unit 1 Draft 1 

> ###### 🛑 Feedback Survey and General Feedback
> The Feedback Survey questions are below and should be used in your #team workshops. I'll interact with you during the week, much like I do with our usual Q&A posts. The [General Feedback](https://visforvali.github.io/eng201-oer/pages/feedback/){:target="_blank"} page will be updated after the workshop week, after I've had a chance to review everyone's drafts on Classes and feedback-related questions in #team.
{: .block-warning }

Answer the below questions for each of your teammates' drafts. Post your responses to your #team channel as a reply to each teammate (or tag them in your post with @username). Keep Staub's framework in mind as you answer them!





> ###### Important!
> No substantive revisions = No credit (Nc). If your revision doesn't implement feedback given in weekly discussions, workshops, and on the general feedback in a substantive manner, then you're likely to receive an Nc score.
{: .block-danger }

1. Has the writer included all 6 sources, at least 3 of which are scholarly peer-reviewed articles? 
2. Does each of these sources feel as though it is *the* ideal source for this paper, carefully selected by a writer with simulated authority, or does it feel more like someone quickly choosing sources? What words, phrases, and other textual evidence indicate this?
3. Has the writer written a specific, distinct summary for each of these sources &mdash; specific summaries being those that don't make the articles all "sound the same" or blur together, but those that help readers identify the arguments, methods, the demographics and/or other factors under study, important subclaims specific to *each* article?
4. Does the writer use the information they provide in these summaries to keep elaborating on, exploring, and complicating their research hypotheses (instead of just using to agree with their research hypotheses)?
5. If sources are used that radically deviate from the geographic location, culture, and demographic the writer's research hypotheses are focusing on, does the writer try to reconcile those discrepancies by specifically explaining how these different aspects align?
6. Does the writer spend an equal amount of space or time to each source? If not, is it clear why the source(s) they spend more time on are more important than the other ones?
7. Does the writer use transition sentences (the 1st and last sentence of each paragraph) to reflect a clear and essential connection to the claim and to the paragraph that follows?
8. If the writer is using popular publications, do you get the sense that they've passed CRAAP, IF I APPLY, and other evaluative tests? Or do they lean towards biased and/or less-than-credible sources, like career advice sites, research boards that are NGOs, university websites, unsubstantiated/op-ed blog posts, Wikipedia or other encyclopedic articles, politically motivated newspapers, chat forums, etc.
9. Does the writer use subheadings that represent the thematic connections in each category? If so, how specifically worded are these subheadings?







## Assignment-Related Questions

- When you compare the draft with the Unit 2 guidelines, what major criteria are absent or need improvement? Tell the writer how they might take care of that.
- What 2-3 items from the feedback survey questions above feel like top priority items for the writer's paper?
- Is there enough background (summarized from the writer's preliminary research) to explain how the writer's research hypothesis emerged from the current state of their field? If not, tell the writer what you still need to know to understand that connection.

While I can't require sync chats with me to go over feedback with you, I highly recommend them if you're able to manage a 10-20 min coffee chat!

Happy drafting and reviewing!
