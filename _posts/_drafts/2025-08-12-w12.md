‚Ä¢	OER: 7. How to Conduct Interviews



Qualitative research collects data through first-hand observation, such as interviews. For this class, students will conduct ‚Äústructured interviews,‚Äù where they will ask all participants the same set of predetermined questions. Qualitative research is valuable because it allows the researcher to explore social interactions, provides an in-depth understanding of how people interact and create meaning, and clarifies ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù these experiences take shape.  

Develop five interview questions related to the selected research topic;
Organize questions in a logical sequence.



By now you should have conducted at least one of your interviews. If the interview is synchronous and oral, you must record it and transcribe it (create a word-for-word transcript).

When you finish conducting and transcribing your interviews, you'll organize this textual data using qualitative coding. Qualitative coding is a fancy name for pattern recognition. Copy all of the transcripts you have so far into one file and label each one with the interviewee‚Äôs name, the date of the interview, the platform (F2F, video conferencing technology, email), and length (time). 

Read them and note the patterns occurring across all three. Write down these patterns, naming them as specifically as possible -- these are your first cycle codes! First cycle codes are the big categories that will include more specific second cycle codes. 

Reference Saldana's piece on coding especially for the following! 

List your first cycle codes at the top of the document & keep them in mind as you go line by line and identify second cycle codes. Try to assign 1-2 second cycle codes to each response, giving them names that connect to your first cycle codes.

Create a color scheme for your second cycle  codes and color-code each line to connect lines to a specific second cycle theme theme. (You may use the comments function instead of color coding if that's easier.) 

Your coded transcripts might look like:

[First Cycle Code 1] Educational Classroom Issues

[List of Second Cycle Codes]

Green = Teaching from a lesson plan
Yellow = Managing behavior

[First Cycle Code 2] Emotional Labor and Mental Health

[List of Second Cycle Codes]
Red = Frustration with administration
Purple = Anxiety about workload
Blue = Supporting students through trauma
Etc.

INTERVIEW 1
Name: [Dialogue. Dialogue dialogue.]
Name: [Dialogue]
Etc.

Try to code every line -- they may be similarly or differently themed -- and post your prewriting as a reply to this thread!

Interviews or Blog/Vlog Analysis 

While students draft their literature reviews, they will conduct primary research in the form of interviews or blog/vlog analysis. Students will apply the questions crafted in Unit 1 in the form of three interviews or three blog/vlog entries. For the latter, students will review three selected blogs/vlogs and answer their interview questions from the material found in the post.  
Requirements:
Determine three possible interview participants;
Conduct and record three interviews (approximately 15 minutes each);
Transcribe interviews. 

Coding Transcribed Interviews and Blog/Vlog Analysis

After conducting and transcribing the interviews, students will code the content. Information is coded for the following reasons:
Codes in qualitative research are as important as numbers in a quantitative study;
Coding the qualitative data makes the messy scripts quantifiable and provides structure;
Your codes give you credibility as a writer with your audience;
Proper coding allows you to say with confidence that your findings truly represent the data you reviewed.

Coding is not looking over your interviews or media content once. The process is far more complex and requires several ‚Äúpasses‚Äù or steps taken to develop categories or themes;
Pass 1: In this step, you will review each interview line-by-line. While doing so, you will write summary statements in the margin of your paper--what you are noticing as you are reading, ideas and statements that directly relate to your research question. For example, you may notice a feeling of anger in the text (not from you). You should make a note of this. To do so, highlight the passage in your Word doc and select ‚Äúcomment.‚Äù Next, write in your thoughts. 
Pass 2: Once you are done with the first pass, you will now want to consider how your codes (for example anger) work together. This is known as developing categories or themes. 
At this stage, you should consider the connection between your codes. For example, codes such as anger, joy, frustration, etc. can be categorized as ‚Äúemotion.‚Äù In your Word doc, assign each code a specific color and highlight all passages accordingly. Again, emotion could be highlighted red for example. 

Develop three categories or themes from your conducted interviews.
