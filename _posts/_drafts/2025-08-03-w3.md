To help with various access needs, including task identification and separation and advance notice, I'll include an abbreviated list of tasks at the top of each weekly module. You can check these items off, but your input won't be saved after you close this window. **You remain responsible for checking the Calendar and ensuring that you're completing everything in a timely fashion.**

As Palmer (2020) observes, researchers tend to ask discipline-related kinds of questions, leading to a variety of scholarly inquiries within one research topic. She offers the example of ‚Äúrenewable resources‚Äù and poses multiple discipline-specific questions:
Business, Accounting, Economics: ‚ÄúWhich renewable resources offer economically feasible solutions to energy issues?‚Äù
History: ‚ÄúWhen did humans switch from the use of renewable resources to nonrenewable resources?‚Äù
Environmental Studies: How can algae be developed at a pace and in the quantities needed to be a viable main renewable resource?
Geography: Which U.S. states are best suited to being key providers of renewable natural resources?
Like many scholars, you‚Äôll need to combine those kinds of questions with the particular asks of the Qualitative Research Project for ENG 201. This means you‚Äôll need to do some reading and writing simultaneously!

Module 3: 
Complete after finishing assigned readings (incl any linked mtl & Your Turn ex in OER)

Begin thinking about your Research Intro of the Qualitative Research Project by exploring the convos in your field around particular social, economic, or personal issues faced by its employees. 

A good way to do this is to look up professional associations in your career field and do preliminary research on Google Scholar using keywords and search strings as outlined in the ENG 201 OER -- refer to the Pace LibGuide for search string tips! Be as specific as possible: e.g., "bioinformatics" is a more meaningful search than "computer science"; "neonatal intensive care unit nurse" is stronger than "nursing"; "racial inequity in salary" is stronger than "salary difference." Change your keywords several times and see how the results change, and try the preliminary research strategies suggested in the OER.

Create a file for this preliminary research (you can call it "Research Dump") and copy-paste the authors/article titles and links that seem most useful right now into it. As you skim the titles that come up in your searches and the abstracts and first paragraphs of these articles, take notes in this document too.

Now, post your keywords and search strings here, along with a paragraph based on your preliminary research that: 

Identifies and describes the discipline you‚Äôre studying (1 sentence)
Identifies and describes some of the problems at large in your discipline (2 sentences)
Based on your preliminary research, what have scholars writing about the discipline already said about these issues? (2 sentences)
What tentative research questions, based on this preliminary research, do you have at present? Phrase them like this: "How does [the problem] affect workers in your discipline? Why does it appear and affect them like that? According to the literature, how do workers seem to cope with it?"
