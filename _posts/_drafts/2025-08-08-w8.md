# Goals and Checklist

- Refresh your umderstanding of how to read scholarly articles
- Develop strategies for integrating both scholarly and public writing using consistent, discipline-specific style
- Understand the purpose of the literature review
- Begin compiling a shortlist of eligible peer-reviewed scholarly articles and articles by public intellectuals in your field

To help with various access needs, including task identification and separation and advance notice, I'll include an abbreviated list of tasks at the top of each weekly module.

that is rhetorical, and a third that combines them both, much like looking through a

Literature reviews ask: What do we know, or not know, about this particular issue/ topic/ subject? 

Literature reviews require “re-viewing” what credible scholars in the field have said, done, and found in order to help you:

    Identify what is currently known in your area of interest
    Establish an empirical/ theoretical/ foundation for your research
    Identify potential gaps in knowledge that you might fill
    Develop viable research questions and hypotheses
    Decide upon the scope of your research
    Demonstrate the importance of your research to the field


How well you answer this question depends upon:

    the effectiveness of your search for information
    the quality & reliability of the sources you choose
    your ability to synthesize the sources you select

A literature review is not a descriptive summary of what you found. All works included in the review must be read, evaluated, and analyzed, and synthesized, meaning that relationships between the works must also be discussed.

The idea of a literature review paper, then, is to first analyze the literature and then synthesize it into a cohesive paper.  Recall that to analyze something means to break it down and examine the component parts.  In research situations, these literature reviews are leading the reader to a point.  Often, the point of a literature review is to provide background for a research hypothesis that the author is evaluating later in the paper.

# Descriptive vs Analytical Writing

Now, consider the following questions and circle or underline where they appear in your own draft:

- What (language, topic, signpost, etc.) feels desperate and why?
- What looks like it's supposed to seem confident but maybe isn't, and why?
- What feels like the author's invested?
- What would you stake on this essay? (That is, is its quality so good you'd bet a million dollars on it?)

Read [this annotated version of the Research Introduction](){:target="_blank"} of one of the model student papers.

["IF I APPLY"](https://libguides.marshall.edu/IFIAPPLY) is a good way to evaluate sources, in addition to the CRAAP method.

Although the 3 interviews for our research project are due by Phase 3 of the assignment, I want you to begin thinking up your questions now so you have time to finalize them before you conduct the interviews later in the semester.
