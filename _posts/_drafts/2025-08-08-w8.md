PARA
Literature reviews ask: What do we know, or not know, about this particular issue/ topic/ subject? 

Literature reviews require “re-viewing” what credible scholars in the field have said, done, and found in order to help you:

    Identify what is currently known in your area of interest
    Establish an empirical/ theoretical/ foundation for your research
    Identify potential gaps in knowledge that you might fill
    Develop viable research questions and hypotheses
    Decide upon the scope of your research
    Demonstrate the importance of your research to the field


How well you answer this question depends upon:

    the effectiveness of your search for information
    the quality & reliability of the sources you choose
    your ability to synthesize the sources you select

A literature review is not a descriptive summary of what you found. All works included in the review must be read, evaluated, and analyzed, and synthesized, meaning that relationships between the works must also be discussed.  



The idea of a literature review paper, then, is to first analyze the literature and then synthesize it into a cohesive paper.  Recall that to analyze something means to break it down and examine the component parts.  In research situations, these literature reviews are leading the reader to a point.  Often, the point of a literature review is to provide background for a research hypothesis that the author is evaluating later in the paper.

This jekyll-theme supports [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) to render diagrams
in markdown.

To enable the mermaid support, you need to set `mermaid: true` in the front matter
of your post.

```markdown
---
title: Diagrams with mermaid.js
date: 2023-08-31
layout: post
mermaid: true
---
```

Then you can use mermaid syntax in your markdown:

```
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

Or, even some complex examples:

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```

```mermaid

    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```
