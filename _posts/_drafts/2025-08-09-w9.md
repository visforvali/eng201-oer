To help with various access needs, including task identification and separation and advance notice, I'll include an abbreviated list of tasks at the top of each weekly module. You can check these items off, but your input won't be saved after you close this window. **You remain responsible for checking the Calendar and ensuring that you're completing everything in a timely fashion.**

e.g.,

```markdown
The well known Pythagorean theorem $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ was
proved to be invalid for other exponents.
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:

$$ x^n + y^n = z^n $$
```

The well known Pythagorean theorem $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ was
proved to be invalid for other exponents.
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:

$$ x^n + y^n = z^n $$

Another example with more complex markups:

```markdown
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
```

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
