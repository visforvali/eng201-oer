# Goals and Checklist

- Review the structure of the literature review
- Finalize and organize your sources in your literature review
- Review the role of synthesis, relevance, and exigence in organizing your literature review

To help with various access needs, including task identification and separation and advance notice, I'll include an abbreviated list of tasks at the top of each weekly module. You can check these items off, but your input won't be saved after you close this window. **You remain responsible for checking the Calendar and ensuring that you're completing everything in a timely fashion.**

The idea of a literature review paper, then, is to first analyze the literature and then synthesize it into a cohesive paper.  Recall that to analyze something means to break it down and examine the component parts.  In research situations, these literature reviews are leading the reader to a point.  Often, the point of a literature review is to provide background for a research hypothesis that the author is evaluating later in the paper.

This [self-guided tutorial](https://iu.libguides.com/literaturereview) by Indiana University-Purdue University LibGuides defines a literature review—including its WID dimensions—and demonstrates how to search, critically read, analyze, and synthesize the literature. 

Stop! Read:
Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega also has a blog post on ["How to Undertake a Lliterature Review"](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2017/04/how-to-undertake-a-literature-review/). 


Signal phrases and words can be used to express the relationship between existing scholarship and your own research, as suggested by this chart from USC's [The C.A.R.S. Model](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/CARS).

In addition to the sample student papers posted to your course’s LMS (Classes), you can find sample student work demonstrating how to write a literature review for the ENG 201 Qualitative Research Project in this [Literature Review/Interviews - Google Drive (OER)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ugdiJxPXvtDQfH21U-GLylhdFxz649c8).

Stop!
It’s time to revisit your preliminary research! Review the articles you initially found and redo your search if your research question/problem statement has evolved since its first formulation. Begin completing the Literature Review Matrix handout provided to you! Remember, this handout is for you to reference when you write the next phase of your paper, so the more information you include, the better!


You should begin thinking about who you might want to interview. Your interviewees should be knowledgeable about your field of study or the research questions you have to some degree. You’ll need to interview 3 people for this project, but remember that not everyone will have the time for an interview. In case a potential interviewee can’t do it, make a shortlist of 6 people, and contact 3 at a time. That way, if someone refuses, you can contact the next person on your list.
Make sure to consider email etiquette when contacting potential interviewees.
•	Be respectful and formal in your language.
•	Introduce yourself and your purpose in writing.
•	Explain, briefly, your research study, what it’s for, and what you hope to better understand from this project.
•	Acknowledge that their time is valuable and ask them (politely!) if they aren’t able to participate, if they can recommend anyone else for it.
Here’s an example email below:


Dear NAME,
My name is _____________ and I am an undergraduate student majoring in ________________ at Pace University. I am writing to ask if I could interview you for a research study for my ENG 201 class on qualitative research and critical writing. The purpose of my research is to better understand how ________________________________.
What does the research involve?
My study consists of an interview conducted in person, over the phone, or via video conferencing (30 minutes). If you can’t meet for this interview, we could conduct it through a text modality, such as Twitter, WhatsApp, or texting.
This research is for a class assignment and will not be published.
If you are unable to participate, I would appreciate it if you could let me know of anyone who might be interested in participating, and who has knowledge or experience of the area of my research.
Thank you for your time and assistance! If you have any questions, please reach out.
Sincerely,
NAME
