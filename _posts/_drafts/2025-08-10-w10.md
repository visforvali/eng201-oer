The idea of a literature review paper, then, is to first analyze the literature and then synthesize it into a cohesive paper.  Recall that to analyze something means to break it down and examine the component parts.  In research situations, these literature reviews are leading the reader to a point.  Often, the point of a literature review is to provide background for a research hypothesis that the author is evaluating later in the paper.

This [self-guided tutorial](https://iu.libguides.com/literaturereview) by Indiana University-Purdue University LibGuides defines a literature review—including its WID dimensions—and demonstrates how to search, critically read, analyze, and synthesize the literature. 

Stop! Read:
Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega also has a blog post on ["How to Undertake a Lliterature Review"](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2017/04/how-to-undertake-a-literature-review/). 


Signal phrases and words can be used to express the relationship between existing scholarship and your own research, as suggested by this chart from USC's [The C.A.R.S. Model](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/CARS).

In addition to the sample student papers posted to your course’s LMS (Classes), you can find sample student work demonstrating how to write a literature review for the ENG 201 Qualitative Research Project in this [Literature Review/Interviews - Google Drive (OER)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ugdiJxPXvtDQfH21U-GLylhdFxz649c8).

Stop!
It’s time to revisit your preliminary research! Review the articles you initially found and redo your search if your research question/problem statement has evolved since its first formulation. Begin completing the Literature Review Matrix handout provided to you! Remember, this handout is for you to reference when you write the next phase of your paper, so the more information you include, the better!
