You can check these items off, but your input won't be saved after you close this window. **You remain responsible for checking the Calendar and ensuring that you're completing everything in a timely fashion.**

Now that you've coded your interviews, you have a mountain of qualitative data to present in your Results section. You do not need to include it all! You should select the most significant codes and associated dialogue for presentation in the Results section. 

Begin with a hypothesis about why these particular themes surfaced in your intervieweesâ€™ responses. Donâ€™t just copy and paste quotes, but include them within your own sentences (as the Writerâ€™s Handbook demonstrates), establishing the speaker and the significance of the portion of dialogue around the quoted portion. 
You could use representative quotes, or quotes that represent the gist of the whole interview with one participant. 


Think back to the Writer's Handbook on paraphrasing, quoting, summarizing

GradCoach has a blog post on the [Results & Findings](https://gradcoach.com/qualitative-results-findings/) Chapter in the dissertation, but the information is relevant to undergraduate research, too. A key difference is that in the ENG 201 Qualitative Research Project, you will present and interpret the results in this one section.
For your Conclusion section, emulate discipline-specific writing moves by examining the conclusions of published peer-reviewed papers in your field (in your own literature review, perhaps!). How short or long are these conclusions? What are common transition phrases and signal words? Do these papers end with summary, gestures at the significance of research, or ideas for future research?

STOP! Write
Review the sample student papers on Classes, in the Google Drive, and Yaleâ€™s repository. How are these Results sections written? Try the following:
Draft a template Results section, using one or more of the sentence and paragraph structures you see happening in these papers, leaving bracketed placeholders ([Placeholder]) in the places where your data will go.
Rewrite this template Results section using the writing moves of your discipline.
Replace any placeholders with the significant quotes and themes, along with your interpretations.
