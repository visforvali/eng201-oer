Research is a messy, imperfect process, with lots of missteps, unexpected turns, and conclusions that are no less important for diverging from the initial RQs


General reminder that the specific organization of your papers, as a general reminder, is in the assignment guidelines (in the syllabus doc). 

Also, make sure to implement feedback as you go


 Being hyperspecific with my word choices when putting them into the search engine,  allows for a more concentrated and precise result of articles and information. 

 An RQ is specific enough when you honestly can't make it any more specific---when every aspect of it has been chased to its narrowest point. If it's too specific at that time, you can begin to broaden your scope. Its much easier to start narrow and go broad than start broad and go narrow, so the initial work of getting specific is a time-saving device in the end!

 I think one of the hardest parts of this for students is letting go of ideas like "what a good paper sounds like" or "what a college professor wants to read" or "I need to make a point and prove it instead of exploring and thinking on the page"

keep in mind that if you don't do what the assignment asks you to do in the spirit that you're asked to do it, you will not receive credit for the assignment. 

The same goes for if you are ignoring feedback or otherwise not engaging in the class (e.g., if you've missed the last 4 weeks of participation, your final course grade will have been impacted, and more importantly, reading your takeaways each week is how I make sure you're on track to succeed).

It's funny how easy it is to summarize doing research as "finding enough sources" or "coming up with a topic" versus how much more complex it feels to sit down and actually do it. So much goes into even just coming up with a strong, specific research question.


As you know now, 


How do y'all see the "attitude towards research" you're beginning to acquire intersecting with writing skills you've already picked up? With other skills or forms of thinking you already use in other arenas/spaces?



As you begin to revise using all the feedback you've gathered this week, make sure your Research Introduction aligns with the following: 

- Your research hypotheses should be exploratory and understanding-oriented
- Existing scholarly literature and familiarity with contemporary discourse of the field should: 1. play a major role in the development of your research hypotheses, and 2. justify the need for exploring the research problem
- 


Let's call it like it is: if y

Avoid this: 




by reviewing the assignment guidelines *frequently*.

Take the time to commit each week's content to memory by re-reading it, even

As well as conducting surveys and gathering comparative data, a good method to gain a deeper insight into a particular approach, or attitudes towards OER is to conduct interviews. This can be as a result of a follow-up from a survey, or by seeking specific individuals (for example, policy makers).

# Addressing Feedback

In feedback list categories of things to do: e.g., at minimum do 1 thing in articulating a critical perspective; 1 thing in citations; 1 thing in XYZ, and identify the things you did and why in a paragraph on your next draft

Read cutting fluff from Abrams' chapter

Revising isn‚Äôt like editing words, it‚Äôs like guessing about the decisions behind big and small choices that make the piece what it is, and noticing your own instincts as a reader

Descriptive vs analytical writing

Consider 

Activity:
Write the ‚Äúwalkthrough‚Äù for someone to replicate your exact process of writing this paper



What (language, topic, signpost, etc.) feels desperate and why?
What looks like it‚Äôs supposed to seem confident but maybe isn‚Äôt, and why?
What feels like the author‚Äôs invested?
What would you stake on this essay? (ie its quality is such you‚Äôd give away a core memory)

If you struggle to recognize where you're making assumptions, try searching Google Scholar, or ask yourself, "Does my professor believe this?" and if the answer is no, then you can't just present it as universal fact

Writing is thinking, not just a record of your thoughts. Only by actually writing do you figure out what you want to say, and how you should say it. (Cassuto)


Module 4 (Interviews/Vlog analysis)
This is a semester-long assignment, so sometimes you'll need to look ahead to later units of drafting to make sure you're thinking about the bigger picture throughout the drafting process. This week, you'll look ahead to the Results section in Unit 3, which will use data from interviews you'll conduct later. 

Identify 5 potential interviewees for your project. These should be people in your discipline who are likely to have experience with or knowledge of the issue, and people who will realistically help you out by doing an interview.
Then, write 5 interview questions that can't be answered yes/no -- think "why" or "how" questions -- and write follow-up questions for 3 of them. Try to write questions that address different parts of your research question!

Your research question may change as you keep writing and as you confirm interview participants. This prewriting activity is just a draft that you can modify before Unit 3 if needed.

Please post your list of potential interviewees and your potential questions as a reply to this thread! (This will be due next week)

Ballenger (2018) says that good questions have the power to open doors to discovery, even with things you might consider uninteresting, like water bottles.

Conducting Effective and Ethical Interviews 
Interviews are a great way to gain insight into individuals and their communities, and they are very 
frequently used for research in several disciplines. Whether a simple homework assignment or an 
extensive project, an interview allows for direct communication between a researcher and a population. 
Although much emphasis is often placed on the role of the interviewee, you may encounter situations 
that call for you to take the leading role in an interview setting. There are several factors that should be 
accounted for in order to conduct an interview as effectively and as ethically as possible.

The process of contacting interviewees will change depending on any prior relationship you 
have established. A close friend or family member may be easily reached through a text, phone 
call, or conversation, and they will likely feel obligated to help you due to your personal history. 
When contacting anyone you do not already know, you will likely have to rely on email, direct 
messages, or phone calls. When reaching out, be sure to include: 
‚óè your name 
‚óè your affiliation as a university student 
‚óè the purpose of your assignment 
‚óè an explanation as to why they would be a good interviewee 
‚óè your contact information  
2 
If you were referred to this person by someone else, it can be a good idea to mention the 
referee. It may also be helpful to include a list of dates and times when you will be available for 
an interview so your potential interviewee already has a schedule they may work with. 
Informed Consent 
Once you‚Äôve located a potential interviewee, be sure to inform them about the purposes and 
the subject matter of the interview as you ask for their participation. Be sure to repeat this 
information immediately before the interview, as well. And, remind the interviewee that it is 
within their right to choose not to answer any questions or to end the interview whenever they 
wish. Remember that, as the interviewer, you hold a great deal of control in this setting. It is 
your responsibility to make sure that your interviewees feel comfortable and that they know it 
is their choice whether or not they participate. Even if you believe that your interview will not 
address any sensitive topics, your interviewee should be aware of their own agency.  
If you must interview a minor, remember that they cannot give informed consent for research 
purposes. If you require their participation, obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian. 
Preparing Questions 
It is always helpful to have at least a few questions ready before the interview begins as you will 
have a stronger idea about what kinds of information you hope to gain. These questions will 
help you and your interviewee stay focused, as well. 
Be sure to phrase your questions so they may not be answered with a ‚Äúyes,‚Äù a ‚Äúno,‚Äù or other 
simple response. These may be appropriate for obtaining small bits of information, but 
questions that begin with ‚Äúhow‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy‚Äù can more easily encourage your interviewee to give 
more detailed responses. Compare the following questions: 
Did you feel nervous on your first day of college? 
‚óè This may be answered with either a ‚Äúyes‚Äù or a ‚Äúno.‚Äù 
‚óè This question assumes that the interviewee felt a certain way and it limits their 
responses. 
‚óè Some interviewees can easily elaborate even if they initially respond with a 
simple answer, but some may only answer the questions that you present. 
How did you feel on your first day of college? 
‚óè This does not allow for a yes-or-no answer. 
‚óè Even if they respond with a one-word answer like ‚Äúnervous,‚Äù you can more easily 
encourage them to elaborate since they were given the chance to reflect and 
3 
consider the best way to answer. A follow-up question beginning with ‚Äúwhy‚Äù will 
most likely be received more easily if the interviewee was given the chance to 
think for themselves. 
Be prepared to go off-script during your interview. Having a structured interview in which you 
ask every participant the same questions may be useful for some assignments. But, asking your 
questions exactly as they are written may negatively affect the quality of your conversation 
because this may appear more unnatural. Be ready to rephrase them or integrate them into the 
conversation in a different way depending on the state of the interview. And, you may come up 
with new questions during the interview itself, so do your best to be adaptable. Using more 
loosely defined questions creates a semi-structured interview, and this style may encourage 
your participants to express themselves more freely. 
Interviewing Etiquette and Effective Listening 
It is important to communicate to your interviewee that you are listening to their responses. Do 
your best to maintain an appropriate level of eye contact. Other good strategies include 
periodically nodding, making affirmative sounds and comments like ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúokay.‚Äù Finally, if 
you need to ask them to elaborate on anything, it may be helpful to make clear references to 
information they have already given you. For example, rather than saying ‚ÄúCould you please say 
more?‚Äù it may be better to say ‚ÄúCould you please tell me more about your first boss and how 
they treated you?‚Äù The first question may leave the interviewee confused about what you 
would like to know, but the second is more specific and gives the interviewee an indicator that 
you listened to them. 
All of these can be effective strategies, but their acceptability will vary depending on the 
interviewee. Making eye contact can show an interviewee you are interested in them and their 
responses, but maintaining persistent eye contact can also make interviewees uncomfortable. 
It will be up to you to strike an appropriate balance for these communication strategies. 
Recording 
When obtaining informed consent, be sure to ask the interviewee if it is acceptable to record 
their responses and whether certain recording methods are acceptable. Below are several 
recording techniques to consider, and there are pros and cons to each.  
Audio/Video Recording  
This is the most simple and reliable way to obtain accurate recordings of your participant‚Äôs 
responses. Your devices are likely equipped with recording software and software for video 
calls have a recording feature as well. However, some participants may feel uncomfortable 
4 
having every statement recorded exactly as it is said, so be prepared with backup recording 
techniques and always ask for permission. And even though you may be recording the 
interview in a hands-off manner, it is still helpful to jot down simplified versions of 
statements alongside timecodes so you can refer back to key places in the interview. 
Handwritten Notes 
Your decision to write notes by hand will depend on your ability to write quickly and legibly. 
Some interviewees may think of handwritten notes as less obtrusive than typing notes. And, 
you and your interviewees may prefer this method because it prohibits many outside 
distractions. Finally, it is always a good idea to be ready to write because your devices may 
not have sufficient power for the entire interview. 
Typed Notes 
Much like handwritten notes, your decision to type notes will depend on your level of 
comfort with a device. But, with all devices, you must consider ease of typing, portability, 
power consumption, and level of obtrusiveness. A laptop or tablet will make typing easier, 
but it is less portable than a cell phone and it may also act as a barrier between you and your 
interviewee. Your phone may work due to its portability, but it may be difficult to type 
quickly and may instead be better suited as an audio recorder. 
‚ÄúOff the Record‚Äù 
Your participant may wish to say something that they would prefer not to be included in 
your assignment. This is known as speaking ‚Äúoff the record,‚Äù and you should withhold 
recording any statements during this time. Be sure to pause your recording software and/or 
stop writing or typing during such moments. When the participant has finished, remember 
to ask for their permission to resume recording. 
Post-Interview Notes 
However you decide to record notes while interviewing, it is always helpful to record your 
own thoughts soon after the conclusion of the interview. You may have noticed particular 
patterns with your interviewee‚Äôs responses or potential connections to prior research or the 
responses of other interviewees, so it is best to record these while they are fresh in your 
memory. 
Debriefing 
Upon completing your interview, be sure to ask if your participant has any final thoughts they 
would like to share. They may have been waiting for an opportunity to share something, but 
felt that it was not an appropriate response for some of your questions. This is a great time for 
5 
an interviewee to elaborate on something related to the interview, so be sure to continue 
recording until you are absolutely sure the interviewee has said all they have wished to say. 
Once you decide to officially end the interview, thank your interviewee and remind them that 
their participation was appreciated and that their responses will be helpful. Some interviewees 
may be curious about the results of your assignment, so be prepared to answer them if they ask 
you to share your work. 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval 
If your class has a primary focus on the research process, you have likely discussed the role of 
the university IRB. Since interviews involve using human subjects, several ethical considerations 
arise. However, if you must conduct interviews for the purposes of a class assignment and do 
not plan to publish or present your findings outside of the class, you do not need to worry 
about obtaining IRB approval. If your assignment requires IRB approval for any reason, your 
instructor will certainly have walked you through the necessary steps. For more information 
about this process, please visit the following link.
