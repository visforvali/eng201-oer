Module 4 (Interviews/Vlog analysis)
This is a semester-long assignment, so sometimes you'll need to look ahead to later units of drafting to make sure you're thinking about the bigger picture throughout the drafting process. This week, you'll look ahead to the Results section in Unit 3, which will use data from interviews you'll conduct later. 

Identify 5 potential interviewees for your project. These should be people in your discipline who are likely to have experience with or knowledge of the issue, and people who will realistically help you out by doing an interview.
Then, write 5 interview questions that can't be answered yes/no -- think "why" or "how" questions -- and write follow-up questions for 3 of them. Try to write questions that address different parts of your research question!

Your research question may change as you keep writing and as you confirm interview participants. This prewriting activity is just a draft that you can modify before Unit 3 if needed.

Please post your list of potential interviewees and your potential questions as a reply to this thread! (This will be due next week)
