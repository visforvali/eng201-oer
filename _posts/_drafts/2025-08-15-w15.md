# Discipline-Specific Writing Models

## Science and Mathematics Papers

[This chapter](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63ee495a9b63895546e9a043/t/64a9a527a3957d6198f3d97b/1688839471301/Scientific+and+Mathematics+Research+Paper+Chapter+Proof.pdf) in the OER Writing the Disciplines focuses on the disciplinary conventions of science and mathematics papers. 

Additionally, [Chapter 22: Appendix B: A Guide to Research and Documentation](https://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/writers-handbook/s26-appendix-b-a-guide-to-research.html) includes a table that lists disciplines, distinctive features, and demands and strategies of disciplinary literacy. The details on Mathematics and Science disciplines are pictured below:

<img src="/assets/math_science_wid.png">

These conventions may apply to students majoring in areas like mathematics and mathematics-adjacent fields (like accounting, business, or economics, depending on the writing task), and the hard sciences (like chemistry, physics, material science, astronomy, and the biological sciences).

## History (and Other Social Sciences)

[Chapter 22: Appendix B: A Guide to Research and Documentation](https://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/writers-handbook/s26-appendix-b-a-guide-to-research.html) includes a table that lists disciplines, distinctive features, and demands and strategies of disciplinary literacy. 

<img src="/assets/history_wid.png">

While these conventions are specific to history, they broadly apply to students majoring in social science areas, like anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies.

Many social science qualitative research papers follow the IMRaD format: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion; ["Boundless Writing"](https://quillbot.com/courses/introduction-to-college-level-writing/chapter/writing-in-the-natural-and-social-sciences-the-research-paper-and-the-imrad-model/) by Quillbot describes this format further. The ENG 201 Qualitative Research Project uses the ILMRaD (Introduction, Lit Review, Methods, Results, and Discussion) model‚Äîalthough the ‚ÄúL‚Äù and ‚ÄúM‚Äù sections may be flipped.

FORMAT PARA

Understanding the ILMRAD Model 
  ILMRaD is an acronym for the standard parts of such an article a scholar or researcher might write in order to report the results of their primary research. 
English 201 is organized around this model, whereas each unit focuses on aspects of the ILMRaD model. ILMRaD is an acronym for sections of a scholarly journal. Below is each letter of the acronym, what it stands for, and what is usually included in each part. Knowing what each section of an article following the ILMRaD model may contain will help you better understand how in this course, each module will focus on aspects of the ILMRaD model.
 In each unit, you will be introduced to the purpose of the section, as well as apply your understanding by research and writing according to the genre conventions of these sections. 
I ‚Äì Introduction 
In the ILMRAD model, the introduction:
Engage the audience‚Äôs interest in the subject matter.
Presents the research question and hypothesis.
Justify why the subject matter is important to research, and why the research question is important to study. This includes demonstrating that this research question has not been adequately addressed by other researchers but also demonstrating how the field of study stands to benefit from this research.
To prepare for 
L ‚Äì Literature Review  (Unit 2)
The literature review can be an important part of your introduction. It provides an overview of relevant research in your discipline, prior to your own primary research. Its goal is to provide a scholarly context for your research question, and explain how your own research fits into that context. A literature review is not merely a summary of the sources you‚Äôve found for your paper‚Äîit should synthesize the information gathered from those sources in order to demonstrate that work still needs to be done.
The literature review refers only to work that affects your particular question and gives all necessary background knowledge (from secondary research) for readers to understand the subject matter and the research question. 
There are a few different ways to organize the literature. In this class, we will organize our literature reviews around common themes found in the sources reviewed. A literature review usually has an organizational pattern and combines both summary and synthesis. A summary is a recap of the important information of the source, but a synthesis is a reorganization, or a reshuffling, of that information. It might give a new interpretation of old material or combine new with old interpretations. Or it might trace the intellectual progression of the field, including major debates. And depending on the situation, the literature review may evaluate the sources and advise the reader on the most pertinent or relevant.
M ‚Äì Method 
The method section is where a researcher lays out exactly how they conducted their research. This includes‚Ä¶
identifying the primary research method used and explaining why it was used; 
As semi-structured interviews are being used, you will include  how you collected, transcribed and interpreted your data.
describing the specific population or phenomena being researched;
explaining how participants were found and why they chose those participants;
and displaying and justify the interview questions.
You also explain the techniques used for collecting (semi-structured interviews) and interpreting data (grounded theory). 
Readers need to see all this information in detail because it is the only way for them to ensure that the research conducted is valid, reliable, and credible.
R ‚Äì Results (Unit 3)
This section is used to display and describe the results of the primary research conducted. This may include percentages or averages for each survey question; an outline or summary of interview results; description of observational data; even tables or charts displaying answers, totals, percentages, or points of observation. As in the methods section, it is important that the researcher is as detailed as possible, providing all the results of the primary research that has any sort of relevance to answering the research question.. Sometimes, this section can be rather short; it all depends on what the researcher has to explain and describe in order to display the results of their primary research.
D ‚Äì Discussion (Unit 3)
In this section, the researcher presents an answer to the research question and justifies that answer based on the primary research conducted. The researcher examines what all the primary research results mean, analyzing the data (in particular the data most relevant to answering the research question or assessing the hypothesis), pointing out how it all goes together in order to address the question. In this section, the researcher lays out the central reasons, even bringing in additional secondary research (from the literature review) to compare to the primary research data, all in order to confirm that the researcher‚Äôs answer is accurate.
For a reader, this section may be the most critical part of a scholarly research report because this is the section in which a scholar or researcher actually proposes an answer to the research question and justifies that answer. It‚Äôs where the scholar explains to readers the meaning and significance of their research results.
C ‚Äì Conclusion (Unit 4) Yes, another letter.
Like the introduction, the conclusion section does a little bit more than a standard conclusion. The researcher should summarize the content of his or her article, wrap up any loose ends, etc.  But a researcher also uses this space to make a final plea for why their answer is both accurate and why it is important. Meanwhile, in this section, a researcher may discuss limitations in their research that may have affected its results and speculate about what additional research should be conducted on the subject in the future.
Note that these sections can vary significantly in length, depending on what a scholar or researcher may need to write about in order to fully and successfully report on their primary research results. As well, a researcher may combine sections (especially if one is particularly short) if it makes sense to do so. Authors may also have latitude about what headers they use to identify each of these sections, or even whether they provide headers for each section at all. So sometimes readers will have to identify these sections on their own (in order to effectively read such an article) based on the content in each.
