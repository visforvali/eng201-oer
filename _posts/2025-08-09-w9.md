e.g.,

```markdown
The well known Pythagorean theorem $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ was
proved to be invalid for other exponents.
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:

$$ x^n + y^n = z^n $$
```

Another example with more complex markups:

```markdown
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
```

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
