# Overview 💯

> ##### Attention!
> You're guaranteed at least a B+ as your final grade if you do everything that's asked of you in the spirit you're asked to do it. But this doesn't mean anything goes! Read on for details.

Grading is the worst part of teaching (for me) and learning (for you). Grades cause anxiety, self-doubt, combativeness, plagiarism, and GenAI use. To counter this, I use an "ungrading" schema: a system that prioritizes learning over grades and rewards experimentation and even the screw-ups that happen when we try out what were learning.

The pedagogical and assessment methods used in PLV core writing courses are probably unlike the stereotypes of writing instruction that you're familiar with (butts in seats, pens to paper, expectations of mastery and assessments that are unrealistic, inequitable, and punitive). Our approaches and policies are designed to support learning as an ongoing, dynamic, trial-and-error process of emulation, experimentation, revision, reflection, and social collaboration (to name a few). 

Nothing in this class needs to be perfect or polished, but this doesn't mean anything goes. I can't measure how hard you feel you tried or give "effort points" for work that ignores the course material. I need measurable evidence of how you're engaging in the class: e.g., frequency of participation, use of feedback, your writerly choices in assignments, etc.

# Basic Checklist ✅

For you to earn at least a B+ in this class, you must:

- Complete all required activities and assignments by the deadline, within the 1-week grace period for late work (where permitted) after the original deadline, or by an alternate deadline that was arranged in advance with me.
- Attempt to write nearly all of the components of required assignments in each draft.
- Regularly incorporate feedback and what you learn in class in your assignments.
- Show that you're paying attention to the instructions, the readings, and feedback by thoughtfully making writerly decisions (choice of readings, interpretive approach, craft and style, etc.) in your assignments.
- Regularly participate in voice and text chat every week.
- Proactively try to figure things out on your own before chatting with me, scheduling coffee chats, and by bringing relevant notes, annotated readings, and writing materials to these meetings so we can work on them together.
- Talk/post about what you've learned when you participate each week: from the readings, from accumulating discussions and activities, from feedback, and/or from your peers' posts (and try to participate even when you aren't sure you're right!).
- Be open to critique and accountable for the work you did (or didn't do).

You can always check in with me if you're unsure of how you’re doing!

If you do better on an ungraded draft than you do on a final submission, I'll score that one instead. This lowers the stakes of drafting even further, allows you to take risks and "fail up" without penalty, and more closely resembles what out-of-classroom drafting is really like: often "one step forward, two steps back," recursive, nonlinear, never quite finished.

# Participation 🙋

> ##### Attention!
> Participation grades are in compliance with university policy for async courses. You're required to participate in discussions and submit work in #classroom and/or other text channels each week. In async classes, you can participate whenever you like during each week, as long as you post by the deadline.
{: .block-danger }

You’re expected to regularly, substantively participate in #classroom each week, through thoughtful, informal contributions that reflect what you're learning; organically reacting/replying to classmates; and doing classwork in a relatively timely fashion. 

Participation takes a lot of forms! While these are all measurable, valid forms of participation, you're expected to participate in different ways throughout the semester:

- Posting at least your 2 required #classroom posts on Discord as required
- Posting in #team to collaboratively learn with your teammates
- Reading and writing with classmates
- Organically replying and reacting to classmates' posts (no boring "discussion board"-style replies, please!)
- Asking questions in #classroom as soon as you're confused

If there's another form that works for you, or if you're anxious about whether you're substantively participating enough, reach out to me so we can talk about it! After 5 weeks of low participation, we'll need to synchronously meet to discuss whether it makes sense for you to stay in the class or withdraw.

# Assignments 📚

You'll produce both high-stakes (major, graded) and low-stakes (minor, ungraded) writing in this class.




PARTICIPATION	━━━━━━━━━━	40%
You’re expected to regularly, substantively participate through thoughtful, informal weekly text + voice chats that reflect what we’re learning; organically reacting/replying to classmates; doing classwork in a relatively timely fashion; and attending coffee chats.


PREWRITING 	━━━━━━━━━━	20%
Some Thursdays (noted on the Calendar), you’ll post prewriting to the weekly channels on Discord to practice what you’re learning and continue developing your qualitative research project. Prewriting threads are posted in advance and can be replied to anytime so you can pace yourself if needed.
QUALITATIVE RESEARCH PROJECT ━━━	40% 
This project is divided into 3 “phases”: Research Introduction; Secondary Research; and Primary Research and Synthesis. Each targets specific parts of qualitative research: Introduction & Methodology (Phase 1); Literature Review (Phase 2); Results (Phase 3); Conclusion (Phase 3). You’ll submit two drafts of each phase: Draft 1, an ungraded process draft for describing and organizing ideas and evidence; and Draft 2, a revision. Your final formatted project will contain these revised, updated versions.
