# Overview üíØ

> ##### Attention!
> You're guaranteed at least a B+ as your final grade if you do everything that's asked of you in the spirit you're asked to do it. But this doesn't mean anything goes! Read on for details.
{: .block-danger }

Grading is the worst part of teaching (for me) and learning (for you). Grades cause anxiety, self-doubt, combativeness, plagiarism, and GenAI use. To counter this, I use an "ungrading" schema: a system that prioritizes learning over grades and rewards experimentation and even the screw-ups that happen when we try out what were learning.

The pedagogical and assessment methods used in PLV core writing courses are probably unlike the stereotypes of writing instruction that you're familiar with (butts in seats, pens to paper, expectations of mastery and assessments that are unrealistic, inequitable, and punitive). Our approaches and policies are designed to support learning as an ongoing, dynamic, trial-and-error process of emulation, experimentation, revision, reflection, and social collaboration (to name a few). 

Nothing in this class needs to be perfect or polished, but this doesn't mean anything goes. I can't measure how hard you feel you tried or give "effort points" for work that ignores the course material. I need measurable evidence of how you're engaging in the class: e.g., frequency of participation, use of feedback, your writerly choices in assignments, etc.

# Basic Checklist ‚úÖ

For you to earn at least a B+ in this class, you must:

- Complete all required activities and assignments by the deadline, within the 1-week grace period for late work (where permitted) after the original deadline, or by an alternate deadline that was arranged in advance with me.
- Attempt to write nearly all of the components of required assignments in each draft.
- Regularly incorporate feedback and what you learn in class in your assignments.
- Show that you're paying attention to the instructions, the readings, and feedback by thoughtfully making writerly decisions (choice of readings, interpretive approach, craft and style, etc.) in your assignments.
- Regularly participate in voice and text chat every week.
- Proactively try to figure things out on your own before chatting with me, scheduling coffee chats, and by bringing relevant notes, annotated readings, and writing materials to these meetings so we can work on them together.
- Talk/post about what you've learned when you participate each week: from the readings, from accumulating discussions and activities, from feedback, and/or from your peers' posts (and try to participate even when you aren't sure you're right!).
- Be open to critique and accountable for the work you did (or didn't do).

You can always check in with me if you're unsure of how you‚Äôre doing!

If you do better on an ungraded draft than you do on a final submission, I'll score that one instead. This lowers the stakes of drafting even further, allows you to take risks and "fail up" without penalty, and more closely resembles what out-of-classroom drafting is really like: often "one step forward, two steps back," recursive, nonlinear, never quite finished.

# Participation üôã

> ##### Attention!
> Participation grades are in compliance with university policy for async courses. You're required to participate in discussions and submit work in #classroom and/or other text channels each week. In async classes, you can participate whenever you like during each week, as long as you post by the deadline. 
{: .block-danger }

You're expected to regularly, substantively participate in #classroom each week, through thoughtful, informal contributions that reflect what you're learning; organically reacting/replying to classmates; and doing classwork in a relatively timely fashion. 

Participation takes a lot of forms! While these are all measurable, valid forms of participation, you're expected to participate in different ways throughout the semester:

- Posting at least your 2 required #classroom posts on Discord as required
- Posting in #team to collaboratively learn with your teammates
- Reading and writing with classmates
- Organically replying and reacting to classmates' posts (no boring "discussion board"-style replies, please!)
- Asking questions in #classroom as soon as you're confused

If there's another form that works for you, or if you're anxious about whether you're substantively participating enough, reach out to me so we can talk about it! After 5 weeks of low participation, we'll need to synchronously meet to discuss whether it makes sense for you to stay in the class or withdraw.

# Assignments üìö

You'll produce both high-stakes (major, graded) and low-stakes (minor, ungraded) writing in this class.

## Low-Stakes Writing

> ##### Attention!
> Low-stakes writing is scored on the basis of completion. Submissions that actively engage with the material and are unafraid of "getting things wrong" on the way to figuring things out are accepted for full credit. If I can't accept a submission for credit for substantive reasons, I'll DM you privately to let you know. **In short: Unless you hear otherwise from me, you know your submission received full credit.**
{: .block-danger }

Low-stakes writing work, i.e. weekly #classroom posts or #team activities on Discord, asks you to briefly organize your thoughts about the course material and your research hypothesis and practice using the writing conventions of your discipline to articulate your thoughts.

**Weekly #classroom posts, i.e. #classroom discussion contributions to help you understand the material, should be posted to #classroom by 11:59PM on Tuesdays and Fridays.** 

By Tues 11:59PM | 1 post asking a specific question about: something you've learned from one of the week's assigned readings about research writing; *or* about something you'd like help deciphering in a scholarly text you're reading for one of your qualitative research project drafts.
By Fri 11:59PM |  1 post attempting to answer one of your classmates' questions (you must answer a question no one else has tried to answer yet, but you can contribute to other questions in addition to boost your participation grade).

Any project-related activities should be posted in your #team channels by the date/time indicated on the [Calendar](../calendar).

QUALITATIVE RESEARCH PROJECT ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ	40% 
This project is divided into 3 ‚Äúphases‚Äù: Research Introduction; Secondary Research; and Primary Research and Synthesis. Each targets specific parts of qualitative research: Introduction & Methodology (Phase 1); Literature Review (Phase 2); Results (Phase 3); Conclusion (Phase 3). You‚Äôll submit two drafts of each phase: Draft 1, an ungraded process draft for describing and organizing ideas and evidence; and Draft 2, a revision. Your final formatted project will contain these revised, updated versions.
