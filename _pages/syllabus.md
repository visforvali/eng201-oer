ENG 201: Writing in the Disciplines serves as the final course in Pace University - Pleasantville's (PLV) three-class core writing sequence, building on the writing skills you learned in ENG 110: Composition and/or ENG 120: Critical Writing. In ENG 110, you developed critical reading and writing skills and explored your writerly identities; in ENG 120, you developed analytical skills and considered how writerly identities are shaped through participation in discourse communities. As a writing in the disciplines (WID) course, ENG 201 builds on these skills with attention to discipline-specific expectations around research writing.

In ENG 201, you'll do qualitative research on contemporary scholarly conversations taking place in your academic or professional fields, i.e. your major or intended career. You'll identify a specific discourse concerning a recent/ongoing problem or tension that scholars in/of your field are trying to figure out &mdash; a problem or tension that repeatedly surfaces in contemporary conversations. You'll be assigned both low-stakes and high-stakes writing, where low-stakes or informal writing assignments are designed to give you time and space to work through a text or complex idea, and high-stakes writing consists of drafts of a qualitative semester-long research study that evolve through peer collaboration, analytical writing, and revision. 

This qualitative semester-long research study is meant to position you as researchers engaging in contemporary, ongoing conversations in your fields. Through developing your understanding of disciplinary genres and the craft of scholarly writing, you'll come to better understand the communicative expectations associated with your field. 

# Learning Outcomes ✅

# Policies for ENG 201 & Pace

> ##### Attention!
> Make sure to read the policies specific to this course! You've probably read Pace's policies a thousand times, but they're provided here again in case you ever need the info. I've labeled them "ENG 201" and "Pace" in case you want to skim/skip Pace's boilerplate stuff.

## ENG 201: Accessibility & Student Support ♿

If something might affect or is affecting your academic performance, please talk to me ASAP so we can work together to meet your needs and the course reqs. I want you to succeed! If you're dealing with issues or a schedule that will affect your performance, please proactively talk to me. You don't need documentation to talk to me about issues impacting your learning, whether it's because of disability, mental health challenges, work, family, stress, etc., and you don't need to disclose personal info, either. Barring emergencies, I need as much advance notice as possible to effectively accommodate you. **We will need to synchronously meet to work out alternate arrangements.** You don't need to disclose any more details than you wish. You can just tell me you're dealing with stuff, and we can strategize ways for you to fulfill the course requirements while taking care of yourself. **I'll do my best to accommodate you, but please be aware that my own capacities only extend so far.**

> ##### Note
> If you select the "Check in Weekly" role on Discord in #get-roles, I'll encourage you to participate each week by DMing you every Monday with basic questions about how you're doing, if you're confused about the materials, and if you'd like to chat sometime. If you need help surmounting any anxiety about reaching out to your professors, choose this role, and reply to me when I reach out to you to get the conversation going!
{: .block-tip }

To request an official accommodation for a qualifying disability, a student must self-identify and register with [Student Accessibility Services](https://www.pace.edu/student-accessibility-services){:target="_blank"} (SAS) for his/her/their campus. NYC SAS may be contacted at 212-346-1199 or 161 William St, 10th Floor. PLV SAS may be contacted at 914-773-3201 or the Administration Center, 861 Bedford Road, Pleasantville. 

## ENG 201: Attendance Policy 🙋

> ##### Attention!
> In this class, attendance doesn't mean showing up and passively existing. You have to actively participate in #classroom and #team text chats to be counted as present. If a ballpark number helps, or if you're looking to boost your overall participation, aim for the minimum required posts (low-stakes homework, teamwork) per week +1.
{: .block-danger }

> ##### Note
> The pandemic isn't over. For information on how to affordably protect yourself from infectious diseases, refer to [this informational resource](https://vyshalimanivannan.com/pandemics-public-health/){:target="_blank"} I put together on pandemics and public health, which includes info on current strains, long-term costs of COVID-19 and post-COVID syndromes, where to buy PPE affordably, and an abbreviated course policy on illness.
{: .block-warning }

Life is stressful: We're dealing with changes in government and social policy &mdash; cuts to open education, equity initiatives that support women, BIPOC, disabled, and LGBTQIA+ folks, social welfare, FEMA, the VA; bans on public health and science communications; attacks on citizenship and ICE raids &mdash; and ongoing problems like the rising cost of living; weather extremes and environmental disasters; gun violence; GenAI's destruction of environment, human intentionality, and reliable information; food recalls; medication shortages; and an uptick in anti-intellectualism and bigotry.

Naturally, all this can impact your class performance, gradually or suddenly. Your participation might also falter due to sickness, religious holidays, and/or Pace-affiliated extracurricular activities. At the same time, because much of our knowledge-making happens during class sessions, your attendance is critical to your success.

Since a large part of your course grade comes from consistent, active participation, the more you post, react, and chat with each other in and out of class, the better &mdash; and since actively participating is how learning happens, it'll help you do better on assignments, too! If you miss a class, you're responsible for reaching out to me in a timely fashion to arrange alternate deadlines and make sure you're on the right track, and for submitting any written assignments, reviewing the week's materials, and asking for notes or help on Discord.

If you get sick or experience some other health challenge, communicate with me early so we can make a plan to make a plan when you’re better. We'll get you caught up when you're well enough to resume participating. As a high-risk disabled individual myself, if I become sick, especially with COVID-19 or another serious illness, I'll need to aggressively rest. You'll have the materials and each other on Discord to help you continue with your learning. I'll rejoin when I'm well enough.

> ##### Note
> I don't want any of us risking our well-being for this class, but I can only overextend myself so much &mdash; meaning I can't give unlimited extensions if everyone keeps getting sick. The more you reduce your risk of getting sick, the more likely we are to finish the course without significant interruptions to course continuity and your learning.

Remember, communal care, mutual aid, and compassion will get us through!

## Pace: Antiracism Education (ARE) ✊🏾

This class is an antiracism education course and fulfills the ARE requirement, so diversity, equity, race, and ethnicity are central to learning content and achieving course goals. In the context of our course content, you’ll learn about commitments to eliminate racism, receive exposure to a variety of perspectives, and acquire an antiracist toolkit that you can use in future classes or workplaces or for social justice causes. Antiracism education is considered necessary for career readiness, so this class will also help you prepare for your future world of work.

## ENG 201: Academic Integrity & Brain-Only Writing 🧠

> ##### Attention!
> You're responsible for following Pace's [Academic Integrity Code](https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/files/student-handbook/pace-university-academic-integrity-code.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Don't invent research data, lie about engaging with a text, fabricate a source, pass off another human's responses as your own, or use GenAI. In accordance with university policy, all violations of academic integrity will be reported to your academic adviser and the Academic Conduct Committee.
{: .block-danger }

Writing is the process of thinking and learning, so do your own work! If you use sources, including the assigned texts, cite them whether you're paraphrasing (translating the text into your own voice) or quoting (using the text's words). If a submission sounds "off" for any reason, and if you're unable to walk me through the writing choices you made and why (what you hoped to accomplish, how your thoughts and wordsmithing were supposed to get you there), then I'm unlikely to accept that submission for credit.

And because writing is thinking, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) technologies &mdash; which are accelerated text prediction machines designed for engagement, not learning &mdash; have no place at any stage of the writing process. Writing is painstaking work we do to refine our ideas and communicate them to others. LLMs are designed to produce plausible sounding permutations of text, with no ideas or thought behind them. They violate academic integrity. They encourage delusion. They destroy the environment. They do all this to produce synthetic, mediocre text in the name of capitalistic imperatives. They reduce your capacity for thought, across human activity. They reduce human intentionality.

If you choose to risk using an LLM in this class, you need to effectively fact-check, rewrite to fit the assignment’s rhetorical context and genre, provide attribution for all the sources GenAI is using, and be prepared to explain your craft choices in terms of the writing ecology they belong to.

Read the rest of the [Writing without AI](https://vyshalimanivannan.com/writing-without-ai/){:target="_blank"} policy and philosophy here. And remember: GenAI/LLM use might be trendy but isn’t inevitable. You do harm to yourself and to the aims of social justice by using it. If you’ve been using it, use this course to experiment with getting back to brain-only writing.
