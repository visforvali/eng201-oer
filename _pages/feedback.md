## What Is General Feedback? 💯

After the first draft in each unit, i.e. Draft 1, Draft 3, and Draft 5, I'll update this page with general feedback &mdash; comments about issues that span 90%+ of the papers in the class &mdash; to help you identify, locate, and address issues in your teammates' and your own drafts during subsequent asynchronous peer workshops. (I'll also participate in these peer workshops, so you'll have the opportunity to verify if you're accurately correlating issues on the General Feedback Sheet to your draft.)

By practicing figuring out &mdash; from a finite set of options &mdash; which bullet points apply to your draft, you'll get better at recognizing similar issues on your own, making you better able to independently revise your writing across the curriculum. 

> ###### Important!
> Drafts of high-stakes writing are scored on the basis of completion. Drafts that actively work towards the project's stated purpose, engage with the material, and are unafraid of "getting things wrong" on the way to figuring things out are accepted and will be marked "C" for "Credit." If I can't accept a draft for credit for substantive reasons, I'll mark it "N" for "No Credit."

Be sure to also review my responses to you and your classmates in #classroom discussion and #team activities. More information about assessment of high-stakes projects is on the [Alt-Grading System](/eng201-oer/pages/alt-grading){:target="_blank"} page. 

> ###### Attention!
> Receiving credit for one draft doesn't mean you don't need to revise or guarantee that you'll receive credit for the next draft. In fact, **revision between drafts is mandatory.**

## How to Use This List ✅

During peer workshops, you and your teammates will work with each feedback item as a survey you can complete for each of your drafts; this list is a static document you can more easily reference on your own whenever you work on revision.

When working with this list *on your own,* I recommend you do the following: 

- Read the first bullet point, then read your draft with that bullet point in mind to see if you can catch the issue on your own
- If you locate it, mark it and make notes to yourself regarding how to address it
- Repeat this process with the next bullet point, and the next, and the next!

In my experience, all of the issues that tend to appear on General Feedback Sheets in are fairly common issues in early drafts in core writing classrooms, so don't feel like you're alone if you find your draft contains most of the items below!




## Types of Feedback
For ease of revision, feedback will be divided into 2 categories: higher-order concerns and lower-order concerns:

**Higher-Order Concerns (HOCs)** include the most important material in your essay, the "big picture," macro-level stuff, i.e. the thesis, claim, or controlling idea; specific connections between your interest in the field and the scholarly discourse in the field; development of your research questions and hypothesis (i.e., "what am I investigating, how do I know what I know, what do I expect to find out?"); your analysis of each piece of evidence; and so on.

**Lower-Order Concerns (LOCs)** include the less important (but not unimportant!) stuff in your essay, like grammar and mechanics: e.g., spelling, fragments, run-ons, punctuation, sentence rhythm variation, word choice.

At least some of the comments on General Feedback Sheets *will* apply to you. If you're not sure which even after team workshops, you can always book a coffee chat with me to determine your next move.

> ###### Tip!
> It also helps to review the Model Student Paper in its entirety, so you have a sense of what you're working towards.
