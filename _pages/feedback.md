## What Is General Feedback? 💯

After the first draft in each unit, i.e. Draft 1, Draft 3, and Draft 5, I'll update this page with general feedback &mdash; comments about issues that span 90%+ of the papers in the class &mdash; to help you identify, locate, and address issues in your teammates' and your own drafts during subsequent asynchronous peer workshops. (I'll also participate in these peer workshops, so you'll have the opportunity to verify if you're accurately correlating issues on the General Feedback Sheet to your draft.)

By practicing figuring out &mdash; from a finite set of options &mdash; which bullet points apply to your draft, you'll get better at recognizing similar issues on your own, making you better able to independently revise your writing across the curriculum. 

Be sure to also review my responses to you and your classmates in #classroom discussion and #team activities. More information about assessment of high-stakes projects is on the [Alt-Grading System](/eng201-oer/pages/alt-grading){:target="_blank"} page. 

> ###### Attention!
> Receiving credit for one draft doesn't mean you don't need to revise or guarantee that you'll receive credit for the next draft. In fact, **revision between drafts is mandatory.**

# A Note on Scoring

> ###### Important!
> Drafts of high-stakes writing are scored on the basis of completion. Drafts that actively work towards the project's stated purpose, engage with the material, and are unafraid of "getting things wrong" on the way to figuring things out are accepted and will be marked "C" for "Credit." If I can't accept a draft for credit for substantive reasons, I'll mark it "N" for "No Credit." **"N" scores are given if you don't submit a draft, if your submission doesn't demonstrate a connection to the assignment or to our course content thus far, or if you did not use feedback provided to the class during weekly Q&A.**

Drafts are ungraded to allow you to experiment with how you implement feedback without fear of penalty.

You might be used to writing courses where you're explicitly told what to do, as though writing and revision are processes that belong to someone else &mdash; processes of making corrections that another person notices and tells you how to fix. In reality, revision has to start and end with you! But since writing is also as an activity of thought that's socially, collaboratively improved, my role as your writing instructor is to provide you with guidance and just enough direction for you to be able to apply your own thinking and figure out what to do with each item on your own after attempting to locate it in your own work on your own. This allows you to think through how to say something &mdash; what research or other work needs to be done in order to say something &mdash; and then decide how you need to put it into action, based on feedback during workshop weeks and all my answers to all your questions each week. 

## How to Use This List ✅

During peer workshops, you and your teammates will work with each feedback item as a survey you can complete for each of your drafts; this list is a static document you can more easily reference on your own whenever you work on revision.

When working with this list *on your own,* I recommend you do the following: 

- Read the first bullet point, then read your draft with that bullet point in mind to see if you can catch the issue on your own
- If you locate it, mark it and make notes to yourself regarding how to address it
- Repeat this process with the next bullet point, and the next, and the next!

In my experience, all of the issues that tend to appear on General Feedback Sheets in are fairly common issues in early drafts in core writing classrooms, so don't feel like you're alone if you find your draft contains most of the items below!

## Types of Feedback
For ease of revision, feedback will be divided into 2 categories: higher-order concerns and lower-order concerns:

**Higher-Order Concerns (HOCs)** include the most important material in your essay, the "big picture," macro-level stuff, i.e. the thesis, claim, or controlling idea; specific connections between your interest in the field and the scholarly discourse in the field; development of your research questions and hypothesis (i.e., "what am I investigating, how do I know what I know, what do I expect to find out?"); your analysis of each piece of evidence; and so on.

**Lower-Order Concerns (LOCs)** include the less important (but not unimportant!) stuff in your essay, like grammar and mechanics: e.g., spelling, fragments, run-ons, punctuation, sentence rhythm variation, word choice.

At least some of the comments on General Feedback Sheets *will* apply to you. If you're not sure which even after team workshops, you can always book a coffee chat with me to determine your next move.

# Higher-Order Concerns

## Unit 1

How do you see the "attitude towards research" you're beginning to acquire intersecting with writing skills you've already picked up? With other skills or forms of thinking you already use in other arenas/spaces? As you begin to revise using all the feedback you've gathered this week, make sure your Research Introduction aligns with the following: 
 

### Qualitative Research Comments

1. **Research hypothesis**. Your research hypotheses should be exploratory and understanding-oriented
2. **Simulation of disciplinary authority**. Existing scholarly literature and familiarity with contemporary discourse of the field should: 1. play a major role in the development of your research hypotheses, and 2. justify the need for exploring the research problem. 
3. Make sure that your question does not only come from you but is informed by a couple of passes of the literature. Your question and hypothesis will likely evolve and change as we keep doing research, but your reader should get the sense that you are informed enough by scholars to not be omitting anything obvious.
4. If your research questions seem unsubstantiated &mdash; e.g., something you think but may not (with a little research) actually be based in statistically significant fact &mdash; the next draft may not be accepted.
5. **Generalization/speculation**. Your research question should avoid generalization and speculation. 
6. For instance, the motives/reasons that people have for behaving a certain way will always be wildly varied; you'll have to conduct a significant number of interviews, and no amount of interviews will be enough to make the case for an argument.
7. You should never be making claims about "people" anyway but about a subset of people that is as specific as it can be. That means considering several factors of identity: race, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality and geographic location, a specific type of company/corporation (banking, pharmaceutical, agricultural), a specific type of law, etc.
8. **Avoid yes/no research questions**. Avoid research hypotheses that are inarguable, factual, or obvious. As discussed in class, research questions/hypotheses whose answers are simply “yes/no” or that can be answered with a fact that the reader could guess before reading your paper
9. For example, "inarguable" claims might include "Why do people want to major in my field?" or "Why do people endure conflict?"
10. **Avoid research hypotheses that are opinions**. You can't argue a claim that is just your opinion, as it only comes from one person and more often than not will not apply widely.
11. Avoid research questions/hypotheses whose answers can be guessed based on common sense. 
12. For example, questions like "Is there a positive effect if impoverished families are given free education," "Will people rely on X law in cases where X law is advantageous to them," or "Do corporations behave ethically" don't merit academic inquiry &mdash; they'll just turn into a report.
13. Don't worry about being too specific &mdash; this is rarely possible, and there are plenty of workarounds if few results come up when you search Google Scholar or Pace scholarly databases for your exact research questions.
14. **Specificity**. A research hypothesis is specific enough when you honestly can't make it any more specific &mdash; when every aspect of it has been chased to its narrowest point. If it's too specific later, you can begin to broaden your scope. It's so much easier to start narrow and go broad than start broad and go narrow.
15. It's *always* better to start with too little literature and expand your questions than to have to rewrite a general approach to have a more specific direction.
16. Your sources must be summarized so specifically that a reader can distinguish clearly between them. For instance: if you say something like "The authors found ways to cope" then you should explain all the ways to cope they found. Imagine that you’re giving these summaries to a friend who didn't do the readings but has to get an "A" on a classroom presentation on them &mdash; that's the level of specificity you're looking for. Thus, avoid offering general or broad summaries of the sources you're using: e.g., if you are discussing a medical study that concludes that women are disbelieved in their complaints about pain, your summary should include the details that make this study unique. Remember, many articles fall into broad categories of theme, argument, school of thought &mdash; you've selected the articles you're working with for a reason, and your readers should be able to grasp that reason from the summaries themselves. Each source should read as distinct from the other sources you're using and from the larger body of scholarship to which they belong.
17.  You should spend an equal amount of space on each of your secondary sources; if you spend more time on a source, make sure to signal to the reader that that source is more important than the other ones and indicate why.
18. Transition sentences (the first and last sentence of each paragraph) must reflect a clear and essential connection to the claim and to the paragraph that follows. For organizational purposes, your transition sentences should signal how your secondary sources connect back to your research hypothesis. Don't just list "this article, the next article, etc."
19. Make sure to draw connections between the sources by referencing them using the authors' last names (which you should mention in the summaries as well). A good model for this is right in front of you: in the pieces you used for your Literature Review! Published scholarship refers to authors by their last names, as you may have noticed. In some cases, it's helpful to mention particularly useful models, frameworks, or concepts. Take 1-2 paragraphs if you need the space to do this work thoroughly.
20. Try to find sources that are about the same geographic location and demographic, or you will have to account for the differences &mdash; e.g., you'll have to tell the reader how an article about a study finding high rates of burnout in healthcare workers in the U.S. in 2020 aligns with a study finding high rates of compassion fatigue in healthcare workers in Sudan in 2023: the first source reflects health-related impacts like COVID, the second source reflects social/ethnic impacts like genocide.
21. Articles about different places can still work together, but it's your job to show the reader how they can be reconciled despite their differences. This is not something that can be shortcut &mdash; trying to get around it with sentences like "These articles are about different places, but they still show high rates of burnout" indicates to the reader that you may not be carefully choosing or reading sources and may not be confident in the material. You'll also need to account for other variables (e.g., if all your articles are about burnout in healthcare professions during COVID, you can reasonably conclude that the pandemic amplified burnout...but you can't conclude anything about burnout outside of the pandemic). This may also mean accounting for the differences between that culture and American mainstream culture and explain why the research is still useful.
22. Make sure you're using peer-reviewed scholarly literature articles published in scholarly journals or books published by university presses. Do not use articles you find on career advice sites, research boards that are NGOs, university websites, blog posts, Wikipedia or other encyclopedic articles, etc.

### Assignment-Specific Comments 

1. **Regularly revisit the guidelines!** The number one thing that is assessed in your projects isn’t perfect argumentation, grammar, or formatting, but are you paying attention to what the project is asking for and trying to address it in a careful, considered way.
2. For example, taking risks in critical thinking that don't work is fine; ignoring that the project investigates a narrow issue that impacts one subset of employees of a field or that the Methodology has a specific structure suggests you aren’t closely reading the project-specific directions or examples 
3. The specific organization of your papers is in the assignment guidelines (in the syllabus doc). 
4. You must address all instructor feedback to demonstrate engagement in the course and assignment goals, which includes weekly #classroom chats, feedback provided in #team, and any direct feedback given to you in any other channel of communication.
5. By this point, with all the work we've done with the Lit Review tutorial and matrix and Unit 2, you should have 6 peer-reviewed sources in your Literature Review section. If you don't, the draft wasn't likely to receive credit. (Depending on how you summarized and thought about the sources in relation to your claim, the draft might have received partial credit.)
6. Your literature review at this point should not look like your annotated bibliography. That is, your citations will not just be pasted in, they will be summarized and synthesized in paragraph form, and they will be divided into clear subsections (3 under each) and applied back to your research question. You should remove signals to yourself like "Source 1, 2, etc." and the word "Subsection" in the subsection headings. At this point, all 6 sources must be included. You should enact correct in-text citation, like using author's last names instead of full titles or "Article #."
7. Make sure you're using two subheadings! So far you should have: Research Introduction; Methodology; Literature Review; Introduction; [Name of Subsection 1]; [Name of Subsection 2]; Review. In the Literature Review section, you don't need to say "Subsection #: Title"; just the title is fine. In Unit 3, you'll add excerpts and analysis of your interview data in the Results section; and a Conclusion for the whole paper. Formatting with sections is important for papers like this, so make sure you're following these directions. 

### Research Process Comments

1. **Turn your questions into hypotheses!** Your research hypothesis is your *answer* to your research question(s); this means that &mdash; if you didn't already, then definitely when you revise and expand for later drafts &mdash; you must provide a provisional answer to the question you pose, based on what you have seen of the literature (so far) and your own critical thinking. Once you have provisional answers that are narrow and that need sustained academic inquiry, you can delete the questions.
2. **Search terms**. Being hyperspecific with your word choices when entering them into the search engine allows for more concentrated and precise results in the articles and information that search yields.
3. Avoid judgment-based words in your literature review like "good" or "bad" and words like "positive" and "negative," which are difficult to substantiate. Saying "this article amazingly does XYZ" isn't convincing and can sound like you're forcing your opinion onto your reader &mdash; if the article really does XYZ well, then your summary and use of the ideas should demonstrate this.
4. Use Purdue OWL's APA or MLA guide (depending on what you're using) to format your Works Cited. Make sure to avoid common pitfalls with in-text citations, like calling authors by their first name, or forgetting to include page numbers (depending on the citation style you're using).

### WID Comments

1. Use your preliminary research and the resources in the [Appendix](/eng201-oer/appendix.md){:target="_blank"}.
2. Make sure to implement feedback as you revise and as you keep writing your way into future drafts.
3. Avoid including information that is unnecessary or irrelevant to your claim.
4. Avoid saying "certain types," "a kind of," "certain people," etc. Name the types; always answer the question "what kind?" where it can be asked. Refer to earlier feedback posts for guidance. You can use specificity to refine your subsection headings, your summaries of your sources, your analysis, etc.
5. Avoid repeating the same information in several sentences. If you need 2-3 "fluff" sentences to help you get to a strong fourth version of what you want to say, delete the prior 2-3. Repetition like this also calls attention to how general and broad the sentence is. If you have too many repeated sentences like this, you risk sounding like you're trying to BS your way to the word count.
