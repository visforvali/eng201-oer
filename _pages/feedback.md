## What Is General Feedback? 💯

After the first draft in each unit, i.e. Draft 1, Draft 3, and Draft 5, I'll update this page with general feedback &mdash; comments about issues that span 90%+ of the papers in the class &mdash; to help you identify, locate, and address issues in your teammates' and your own drafts during subsequent asynchronous peer workshops. (I'll also participate in these peer workshops, so you'll have the opportunity to verify if you're accurately correlating issues on the General Feedback Sheet to your draft.)

By practicing figuring out &mdash; from a finite set of options &mdash; which bullet points apply to your draft, you'll get better at recognizing similar issues on your own, making you better able to independently revise your writing across the curriculum. 

Be sure to also review my responses to you and your classmates in #classroom discussion and #team activities. More information about assessment of high-stakes projects is on the [Alt-Grading System](/eng201-oer/pages/alt-grading){:target="_blank"} page. 

> ###### Attention!
> Receiving credit for one draft doesn't mean you don't need to revise or guarantee that you'll receive credit for the next draft. In fact, **revision between drafts is mandatory.**

# A Note on Scoring

> ###### Important!
> Drafts of high-stakes writing are scored on the basis of completion. Drafts that actively work towards the project's stated purpose, engage with the material, and are unafraid of "getting things wrong" on the way to figuring things out are accepted and will be marked "C" for "Credit." If I can't accept a draft for credit for substantive reasons, I'll mark it "N" for "No Credit." **"N" scores are given if you don't submit a draft, if your submission doesn't demonstrate a connection to the assignment or to our course content thus far, or if you did not use feedback provided to the class during weekly Q&A.**

Drafts are ungraded to allow you to experiment with how you implement feedback without fear of penalty.

You might be used to writing courses where you're explicitly told what to do, as though writing and revision are processes that belong to someone else &mdash; processes of making corrections that another person notices and tells you how to fix. In reality, revision has to start and end with you! But since writing is also as an activity of thought that's socially, collaboratively improved, my role as your writing instructor is to provide you with guidance and just enough direction for you to be able to apply your own thinking and figure out what to do with each item on your own after attempting to locate it in your own work on your own. This allows you to think through how to say something &mdash; what research or other work needs to be done in order to say something &mdash; and then decide how you need to put it into action, based on feedback during workshop weeks and all my answers to all your questions each week. 

## How to Use This List ✅

During peer workshops, you and your teammates will work with each feedback item as a survey you can complete for each of your drafts; this list is a static document you can more easily reference on your own whenever you work on revision.

When working with this list *on your own,* I recommend you do the following: 

- Read the first bullet point, then read your draft with that bullet point in mind to see if you can catch the issue on your own
- If you locate it, mark it and make notes to yourself regarding how to address it
- Repeat this process with the next bullet point, and the next, and the next!

In my experience, all of the issues that tend to appear on General Feedback Sheets in are fairly common issues in early drafts in core writing classrooms, so don't feel like you're alone if you find your draft contains most of the items below!

## Types of Feedback
For ease of revision, feedback will be divided into 2 categories: higher-order concerns and lower-order concerns:

**Higher-Order Concerns (HOCs)** include the most important material in your essay, the "big picture," macro-level stuff, i.e. the thesis, claim, or controlling idea; specific connections between your interest in the field and the scholarly discourse in the field; development of your research questions and hypothesis (i.e., "what am I investigating, how do I know what I know, what do I expect to find out?"); your analysis of each piece of evidence; and so on.

**Lower-Order Concerns (LOCs)** include the less important (but not unimportant!) stuff in your essay, like grammar and mechanics: e.g., spelling, fragments, run-ons, punctuation, sentence rhythm variation, word choice.

At least some of the comments on General Feedback Sheets *will* apply to you. If you're not sure which even after team workshops, you can always book a coffee chat with me to determine your next move.

# Higher-Order Concerns

## Unit 1

How do you see the "attitude towards research" you're beginning to acquire intersecting with writing skills you've already picked up? With other skills or forms of thinking you already use in other arenas/spaces? As you begin to revise using all the feedback you've gathered this week, make sure your Research Introduction aligns with the following: 
 

### Qualitative Research Comments

- Your research hypotheses should be exploratory and understanding-oriented
- Existing scholarly literature and familiarity with contemporary discourse of the field should: 1. play a major role in the development of your research hypotheses, and 2. justify the need for exploring the research problem
- A research hypothesis is specific enough when you honestly can't make it any more specific &mdash; when every aspect of it has been chased to its narrowest point. If it's too specific later, you can begin to broaden your scope. It's so much easier to start narrow and go broad than start broad and go narrow.

### Assignment-Specific Comments 


- The specific organization of your papers is in the assignment guidelines (in the syllabus doc). 
- You must address all feedback to demonstrate engagement in the course and assignment goals, which includes weekly #classroom chats, 



The same goes for if you are ignoring feedback or otherwise not engaging in the class (e.g., if you've missed the last 4 weeks of participation, your final course grade will have been impacted, and more importantly, reading your takeaways each week is how I make sure you're on track to succeed).




### Research Process Comments

- Being hyperspecific with your word choices when entering them into the search engine allows for more concentrated and precise results in the articles and information that search yields.

### WID Comments

Make sure to implement feedback as you go
