Hello! On our Discord server, I'm fhqwhgads (a [Homestar Runner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=votBDwhTu1E){:target="_blank"} reference); IRL, I'm Dr. Mani. I'll be your professor for ENG 201: Writing in the Disciplines this semester. I'm an Eelam Tamil American chronically ill writer, scholar, artist, and designer. I've taught writing and rhetoric, media studies, disability studies, and cultural studies for ~20 years. I have a PhD in Communication, Information, and Media from Rutgers and an MFA in Creative Writing from Columbia. I'm interested in digital multimodal composition, disability justice movements (mask up 😷 for your community!), and body mods. I have a Siberian cat named Athena ([obligatory cat tax](/eng201-oer/assets/gitbook/images/cat_tax.jpg){:target="_blank"}).
