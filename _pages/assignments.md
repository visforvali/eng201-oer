# Low-Stakes Writing



# High-Stakes Writing

> ##### Attention!
> Make sure to review the instructions for each phase before and while you draft and revise.
{: .block-danger }



You'll cumulatively draft a semester-long qualitative research paper in this class, across 3 "parts" or "phases," with 2 drafts per phase. While your drafts don't have to be polished until the final submission, I recommend you submit a draft that's as complete as possible &mdash; the more there is for me to review, the more targeted your classmates and I can be with our feedback.


With each second draft, you'll also submit an informal reflection (2-3 para.), in which you'll identifying your writerly choices and explaining why you made those decisions (as opposed to others) in your research and writing. 

The semester-long qualitative research project is divided into 3 “phases” of drafting:
•	Phase 1: The Research Introduction
•	Phase 2: Secondary Research
•	Phase 3: Primary Research and Synthesis
To make this project manageable for you, in each phase, you’ll work on the different parts of a typical qualitative research paper:
•	Introduction (Phase 1)
•	Methodology (Phase 2)
•	Literature Review (Phase 2)
•	Results (Phase 3)
•	Conclusion (Phase 3)
The final, full project will include each of these parts, titled with these subheadings, in the order listed above. 
Each phase includes 2 drafts:

•	Draft 1 is an ungraded rough process draft, where you begin describing, explaining, and organizing your raw data and thoughts. Draft 1 might contain notes to yourself, questions for me, copy-pasted secondary or primary data from your “Research Dump” file, or “[I know something goes here but I don’t know what yet]” placeholders—features of a rough draft. 
•	Draft 2 is a more complete, revised version of Draft 1, with a short (~250-500) reflection about your writing process and decisions you made while writing. Since you’ll be working on this paper all semester, it’s OK if it’s rough until the final submission. As you read and think over the semester, parts of your paper may change, sometimes drastically, and that’s OK too. 
The final, full project (Phase 3 Draft 2) should be cleared of features of a rough draft. 
Due dates for all drafts are listed in the Calendar. 

## Process Reflections

After you submit each draft, you'll post a reflection to your #team channel in which you describe:

- Your top 3 goals (in relation to the assignment criteria) in this draft
- The writing choices you made to try to achieve those goals
- Why you thought those choices were the most effective ones to make
- Where in your draft you think these choices are most apparent

This info will be useful when your team begins workshopping drafts with the general feedback sheet. 

You can also note any material circumstances that got in the way of your drafting and what you might need to do (or what support you might need) to avoid similar hindrances next time. Don't just say that you learned a lot or restate the course material &mdash; think of this as your chance to tell me how you're implementing the course material into your writing practice! 

# Phase 1: Research Introduction

Length: ~750 words
This part of the qualitative research project has two titled sections, “Research Introduction” (3-4 paragraphs) and “Methodology” (2 paragraphs). 
The Research Introduction addresses:
•	Why you’re interested in this discipline (1 paragraph)
•	Identification and description of the issue in the discipline you plan to examine, based on conversations in the field (1 paragraph)
•	Research hypothesis (unanswered research questions are OK for now) and aims of the study (1 paragraph)
The research hypothesis is the hardest, most important part of your paper! You can think of the research hypothesis as a non-obvious, unprovable conclusion you’re drawing about an ongoing conversation in your field. This issue should be something employees regularly deal with (not clients or society at large). 
Your hypothesis should consider the impact of this issue on the field. For instance:
•	Identity-based discrimination (gender, race, class, sexuality, able-bodymindedness) in hiring or promotion
•	Mental health issues like trauma, stress, overwork, compassion fatigue, or other cognitive or emotional burdens (choose one)
•	Problems with training current or future employees in the field
•	Ethics in conducting research
•	Etc.
You can choose one of the issues you identified in low-stakes prewriting on Discord, or a new one you’ve since discovered in conversations in the field. It’s normal for your hypothesis to change as you keep drafting and researching, so don’t worry if you end up somewhere different than where you started later in the semester!
The Methodology section is 2 paragraphs and will be added to your draft in Phase 1 Draft 2 or later:
•	Paragraph 1: 
o	The names and positions of 3 potential interviewees in the discipline
o	The mode of “data collection” (structured interviews, for this project)
o	5 interview questions and probes
•	Paragraph 2:
o	How you will conduct the interviews (the modality)
o	How long the interviews took
You don’t have all this information right now, so feel free to insert “[to be finished later]” placeholders. Write this section in the past and present tenses and complete it once you’ve conducted your interviews. 

# Phase 2: Secondary Research

Length: ~1000-1200 words minimum
This part of the qualitative research project has one section, titled “Literature Review.” You will add these sections after the “Methodology” section from Phase 1. 
The Literature Review asks you to explore existing peer-reviewed scholarship on the disciplinary issue you’re exploring. You’ll tell your readers about previous research on the topic by summarizing and synthesizing 6 articles, identifying 2 important themes, and connecting the research with your own research hypothesis. 
Strong literature reviews use sources that examine different themes/ideas in the research hypothesis. Weak literature reviews try to “match” or “prove” the research hypothesis.
The Literature Review section is at least 8 paragraphs and includes 4 subsections of its own:
•	Introduction (1 paragraph): Name and describe the significance of the 2 themes you noticed in OER “Your Turn!” and Discord prewriting activities
•	Theme 1 (3 paragraphs): Title this section with the name of one of the themes and summarize the 3 articles that illustrate this theme, dedicating 1 paragraph to each article.
•	Theme 2 (3 paragraphs): Title this section with the name of one of the themes and summarize the 3 articles that illustrate this theme, dedicating 1 paragraph to each article.
•	Conclusion (1 paragraph): Title this section “Conclusion.” Summarize the connection between these specific 6 sources and your research hypothesis.
You should add a Works Cited at the end of your paper. Your citations can be APA or MLA as long as you’re consistent. The Works Cited section doesn’t have to be fully formatted and polished until the final draft, but I recommend keeping track of all the sources you’re using with bibliographic information (not links!) to make sure you know what they are later.

# Phase 3: Primary Research and Synthesis

Length: ~1000 words minimum
This part of the qualitative research project has two titled sections, with the subheadings “Results” and “Conclusions.” You’ll add these sections after the “Literature Review” section from Phase 2. 
The Results section is at least 5 paragraphs and includes:
•	Paragraph 1: Name and describe the significance of the most exemplary codes (patterns) from your interviews. Explain how they connect to your research hypothesis.
•	Paragraph 2-4: Evidence from each interview transcript demonstrating each theme you identified in Paragraph 1. You should organize these paragraphs by idea, so you can include evidence from each interview in a single paragraph.
•	Paragraph 5: How does your interview data expand on, complicate, or challenge your research hypothesis? (It’s OK if the data contradicts your hypothesis; explain outlier data instead of ignoring it.)
This section is where you translate your primary research—your interviews—from transcripts to paragraphs. Using thinking and writing from OER “Your Turn!” and Discord prewriting activities, you’ll identify 2-3 exemplary patterns (codes), connect them to your research hypothesis, and offer quotes from each of the 3 interviews as evidence of those patterns. You should organize your evidence in order of significance to your research hypothesis.
In the Conclusion section, you’ll synthesize your interviews (primary research) and literature review (secondary research) and explain what you’ve learned about your research hypothesis and the topic of study. In short, try to explore the following questions: 
•	What are the takeaways of your research? 
•	What are possible new areas of study related to this topic of study?
