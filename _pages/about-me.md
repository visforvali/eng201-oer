Hello! I'm Dr. Mani, and I'll be your professor for [ENG 201: Writing in the Disciplines](#){:target="_blank"} this semester. I'm an Eelam Tamil American chronically ill writer, scholar, artist, and designer. I've taught writing and rhetoric, media studies, disability studies, and cultural studies for ~20 years. I have a PhD in Communication, Information, and Media from Rutgers and an MFA in Creative Writing from Columbia. I'm interested in digital multimodal composition, disability justice movements (mask up 😷 for your community!), and body mods. I also have a Siberian cat named Athena ([obligatory cat tax](/eng201-oer/assets/gitbook/images/cat_tax.jpg){:target="_blank"}).
