Hello! I'm Dr. Mani, and I'll be your professor for ENG 201: Writing in the Disciplines this semester. I'm an Eelam Tamil American chronically ill writer, scholar, artist, and designer. I've taught writing and rhetoric, media studies, disability studies, and cultural studies for ~20 years. I have a PhD in Communication, Information, and Media from Rutgers and an MFA in Creative Writing from Columbia. I'm interested in digital multimodal composition, disability justice movements (mask up 😷 for your community!), and body mods. I also have a Siberian cat named Athena ([obligatory cat tax](/eng201-oer/assets/gitbook/images/cat_tax.jpg){:target="_blank"}).

> ##### Attention!
> I reserve 5 hrs/wk for by-appointment coffee chats on Discord. You can book a 🕐10, 🕐15, or 🕧20 min chat with me over voice-and-video or voice-only (ideal for commutes and work breaks) chat to talk about any aspect of your classwork, college, life, etc. **If you're in an async section, please be aware that I can't require sync one-on-one meetings and therefore have limited availability outside of these hours.** You can DM me to arrange an alternate time, but you must contact me **at least 1 week in advance**. I'm almost never able to accommodate last-minute requests.
{: .block-danger }

> ##### Important!
> I respond to async messages in Discord's text channels and DMs and Pace emails within 48 hrs during the week. Anything I get over the weekend, I'll respond to on Mon (I might reply sooner, but don't count on it). For a quicker response to questions or project help, ask in #classroom or #team on Discord. I deprioritize questions about course material/logistics that are explained in the course syllabus and/or this website, or have already been asked and answered on Discord and added to the FAQs.
{: .block-warning }

> ##### Weekly Workflow and Deadlines
> Unless otherwise noted, **every week, you'll post at least one discussion question to #classroom by Tue 11:59PM and reply to at least one classmate's question with an attempted answer by Fri 11:59PM** to qualify as present and actively participating for the week. (For specific instructions, check out [Assignments](/eng201-oer/pages/assignments){:target="_blank"}.) You don't need to have completed the module by the time you post.

# Course Calendar

The calendar of readings and learning modules to be completed asynchronously each week is posted below. If I change the schedule to benefit the class, I'll post an announcement to Discord #classroom and to the [Announcements](/eng201-oer/jekyll/2025-07-31-w0.html){:target="_blank"} page at the top of the sidebar.

> ##### Suggested Sat-Fri Workflow
> Because this is an asynchronous section, the calendar below includes weekends and runs from Sat-Fri &mdash; but this is just a suggestion. You can complete the work whenever you're able during the week as your schedule permits. Regardless of when you find the time, you're expected to pace yourself, manage your time, and stay on top of deadlines, and you must complete all the work each week to remain in good standing in the course.
