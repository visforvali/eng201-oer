Hello! I'm Dr. Mani, and I'll be your professor for ENG 201: Writing in the Disciplines this semester. I'm an Eelam Tamil American chronically ill writer, scholar, artist, and designer. I've taught writing and rhetoric, media studies, disability studies, and cultural studies for ~20 years. I have a PhD in Communication, Information, and Media from Rutgers and an MFA in Creative Writing from Columbia. I'm interested in digital multimodal composition, disability justice movements (mask up 😷 for your community!), and body mods. I also have a Siberian cat named Athena ([obligatory cat tax](/eng201-oer/assets/gitbook/images/cat_tax.jpg){:target="_blank"}).

> ##### Attention!
> I reserve 5 hrs/wk for by-appointment coffee chats on Discord. You can book a 🕐10, 🕐15, or 🕧20 min chat with me over voice-and-video or voice-only (ideal for commutes and work breaks) chat to talk about any aspect of your classwork, college, life, etc. Book early and often! If these times don't work for your schedule, DM me to try to arrange an alternate time. **If you're in an async section, please be aware that I can't require sync one-on-one meetings and therefore have limited availability outside of these hours.** You must contact me **at least 1 week in advance** to schedule a chat outside of my standard coffee chat times. I’m almost never able to accommodate last-minute requests.

> ##### Important!
> I respond to async messages in Discord's text channels and DMs and Pace emails within 48 hrs during the week. Anything I get over the weekend, I'll respond to on Mon (I might reply sooner, but don't count on it). For a quicker response to questions or project help, ask in #classroom or #team on Discord. Please note that I deprioritize questions about course material/logistics that are explained in the course syllabus and/or this website, or have already been asked and answered on Discord and added to the FAQs on this site. **For privacy reasons, the invitation link to our server is only posted to Classes.**
{: .block-warning }

> ##### Weekly Workflow and Deadlines
> Unless otherwise noted, **you'll post your discussion questions to #classroom by Tue 11:59PM or earlier every week, and reply to a classmate's question with an attempted answer by Fri 11:59PM or earlier every week** to qualify as participation for the week. (For specific instructions, check out [Assignments](/eng201-oer/_pages/assignments){:target="_blank"}.) You don't need to have completed the module by the time you post.
